<small>SHE WITNESSES THE DEPARTURE OF THE
OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">By</span> this time the awning had been spread.
In the cuddy a crowd of convicts were roaring
out the chorus of some vulgar popular
song of that time. Will said: &#8216;We have had
nothing to eat. Aren&#8217;t you hungry?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Here, you!&#8217; exclaimed Tom to the fellow
at the helm. &#8216;Jump below to the cuddy
and bring us some food and wine to breakfast
off. I&#8217;ll not trust this young gentleman
amongst them. You&#8217;re known as a friend.
Johnstone, hold the wheel.&#8217;</p>

<p>The man went like a dog to the companion-hatch
and disappeared down it.</p>

<p>&#8216;A worthy example of the British sailor,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>&#8217;
said Tom. &#8216;He&#8217;s one of those fellows who&#8217;d
swear a man&#8217;s life and liberty away for a
noggin of rum. D&#8217;ye see that boat, Marian?&#8217;
He pointed to a long thin boat, called the
captain&#8217;s gig, that hung by davits over the
stern, with the line of her gunwale on a level
with the taffrail. &#8216;She&#8217;ll give us our chance.
Johnstone, that&#8217;ll be the boat we&#8217;ll make off
in. The sooner the better. Hark to them
below! Oh, my dear heart, what has your
love for me brought you into? Johnstone,
the equipment of that boat will be your duty.
I shall hold you responsible for everything
being in its place when we come to want
her.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Aye, aye, sir,&#8217; answered the lad, with
the habit of a sailor in answer to an order.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is it true, Tom, that they&#8217;d hang you if
they found you in command of this ship?&#8217;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s been murder and piracy, and the
ringleaders would be hanged, and I, found in
command of the ship, would be reckoned a
ringleader. But do not fear. They&#8217;re not
going to catch me. We&#8217;ll be out of the vessel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
soon, though heaven help the unhappy ruffians
when it comes to our leaving them.&#8217;</p>

<p>Presently the sailor came up out of the
cuddy. He brought a bottle of sherry, a
broken tumbler, a plate of white biscuit, and
some tinned meat. He said sullenly, as he
put the stuff down on the grating, that it was
all he could find. There wasn&#8217;t a whole
tumbler to be seen.</p>

<p>&#8216;Them convicts is gone mad,&#8217; he said, as
he sulkily grasped the wheel. &#8216;Them as
ain&#8217;t singing&#8217;s fighting. The cabin floor&#8217;s a-running
with blood. They&#8217;re mostly the
young &#8217;uns. I never bargained for the likes
of this raree-show. What&#8217;s a-going to befall
the fired ship if this sort of carrying-on&#8217;s to
last?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It was to be a roasting hot job,&#8217; said I
pointing to the injured topgallantmast.</p>

<p>He gave me an evil look, but, meeting
Tom&#8217;s eyes, turned his head and stared away
into the white, sultry, stagnant distance. I
kept my back upon the bloodstains; I could
not have held them in view and tasted food.
Whilst we ate and drank we heard Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
Bates calling out orders on the main-deck.
I met Tom&#8217;s glance; he faintly smiled; it
was the first time I had seen him smile.
But, indeed, the tragedy of the morning became
a kind of burlesque, when you thought
of the chief mate of the ship, dressed as a
convict, giving orders under the eye of Barney
Abram, who was himself clothed in the
apparel of the captain.</p>

<p>We moved forward a little way to get
well into the shelter of the awning and out
of hearing of the fellow at the wheel. The
bottle had been half full. We emptied it and
threw it and the broken tumbler overboard,
and talked whilst we watched the motions
of the convicts on the main-deck and listened
to the choruses of the brutal revellers
in the cuddy. Some of the mutinous sailors
went aloft with tackles on the main and fore-yards;
meanwhile a number of the convicts
cleared away the long-boat, a large, squab
fabric which lay stowed forward of the galley.
Tom said she was big enough to safely carry
forty souls.</p>

<p>&#8216;I wish you and I and Will there were in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
her,&#8217; said he, out of sight of this ship. &#8216;But
she&#8217;ll provide us with the opportunity we
want,&#8217; he added, with a sideway motion of his
head towards the gig over the stern.</p>

<p>&#8216;What are your plans after we leave the
ship?&#8217; said I. &#8216;The gig&#8217;s a little boat for this
vast sea.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;My plans,&#8217; he answered, making as if
he would take my hand, and arresting the
gesture with a fierce glance at the helmsman,
&#8216;are first of all to get away. The rest must
be our fortune. Anyhow, we&#8217;ll endeavour to
keep afloat till we&#8217;re picked up.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It might run into weeks before we fall
in with a ship just here,&#8217; said Will, &#8216;and
what&#8217;s to happen then? It&#8217;s very well for
Marian and me&mdash;what&#8217;s to become of you,
sir?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s to become of Tom?&#8217; cried I.
&#8216;If you mean that, you must ask what&#8217;s to
become of me too.&#8217;</p>

<p>Tom stood up and said: &#8216;The convicts
mustn&#8217;t see us always together, and particularly
will it not do for them to see us talking
earnestly. They&#8217;re felons, with the suspicions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
and passions of felons. I&#8217;m going to the
captain&#8217;s cabin.&#8217;</p>

<p>He walked briskly to the companion-way,
at which he paused to look steadily round the
sea, and then disappeared.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why do you take me up so sharply,
Marian?&#8217; said Will.</p>

<p>&#8216;Call me Marlowe. Suppose you should
be overheard? Sharply? Why do you ask
what&#8217;s to become of Tom? It never could
be right with me if it&#8217;s to be wrong with him.
And yet you say it&#8217;ll be all right for you and
me if we&#8217;re picked up.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;If we&#8217;re picked up he may be carried to
England. What then?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;ll not allow ourselves to be picked
up by a ship going to England.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We may be nearly dead with thirst and
without provisions. Look what a sea it is!
Do you know where we are? This is the
junction of the two Atlantics. If you are
dying of thirst you&#8217;ll be glad to be picked
up, though the ship we should fall in with
were bound to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;&#8217; And my cousin, with
an expressive face, pointed downward.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>&#8216;Don&#8217;t talk to me. Leave it all to Tom.
He is an old sailor, and will he risk the
liberty he has got this day? I would sink
and drown in his arms sooner than stay in
this detestable ship, or not be by his side
wherever he goes!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Aye, that&#8217;s all very well. But I&#8217;m to
make one in the boat, remember. I&#8217;m very
sorry for Butler, and like him greatly, although
hang me if I think his prison experience has
improved his manners. But I don&#8217;t see my
way to go down hand in hand with him.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Hold your tongue!&#8217; I cried. &#8216;The
darling saved your life, and this is your
gratitude!&#8217;</p>

<p>He got up and walked aft, and stood
looking at the gig.</p>

<p>I walked to the poop-rail and gazed down
at the mass of convicts who filled the decks.
Some of them were throwing the remains of
the barricades overboard. A considerable
group stood near the port gangway, and
every one of that gang carried a soldier&#8217;s
musket, with its bayonet fixed. Some of
those fellows had acted as first and second<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
&#8216;captains&#8217; under the doctor. They were now
less noisy in the cuddy; a few in that interior
did, indeed, continue to drunkenly shout out
choruses. Here and there a felon roamed
with lurching steps, and often with a cut face
and blood upon him as though from a savage
scuffle; but I soon noticed that if this sort of
fellows got into the people&#8217;s way they were
elbowed and kicked without ceremony even
to the extent of being thrown headlong.
Most of the noisiest and the wounded people
were young. In truth, already was I sensible
of a change in the bearing of the unhappy
men. They stood in bodies watching what
was going forward. The first clamorous,
brutal transports, the early delirious passions
which successful rebellion and the possession
of freedom had excited, were sobering. Perhaps
they had not met with drink enough yet
to make them all the fierce, wild, shouting,
exulting demons some of them had been
changed into by the cuddy drams. Be this
as it may, there was less confusion; the
senseless bawling had become rare. On deck,
the shouts broke only from the throats of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
tipsy scoundrels aimlessly issuing out of the
cuddy into the quarter-deck throng, where,
as I have said, they would be hustled and
kicked, and sometimes forced into silence by
being knocked down.</p>

<p>Mr. Bates, no longer distinguishable from
the felons who remained clothed in the
convicts&#8217; garb, stood at the gangway, superintending
the hoisting and lowering of the
long-boat over the side. Some of the convicts
worked as though they had been sailors in
their day. Close beside the little mass of
armed men stood Barney Abram, and near
him were five or six convicts, variously attired
in plundered clothes. These fellows were,
without exception, of the better class of
prisoners. Most of them had filled positions
of some little trust under the doctor, such as
cook and barber, and I guessed that they were
among the recognised heads of the risen
criminals.</p>

<p>Will joined me and began to talk of the
gig and the difficulty of safely lowering a
boat hanging athwartships when a vessel was
in motion. I bid him leave everything to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
Tom and do as he was told&mdash;that is, to see
that the gig was furnished ready for getting
away in. He burst into a laugh at sight of
Mr. Bates, and for some time could not
recover his composure; in truth, the poor
fellow seemed a little hysterical, and after we
had been standing a few minutes drew me
away, saying; &#8216;Let&#8217;s go over to starboard;
the sentry was killed just here, and I keep on
seeing his face as they threw him over the
side.&#8217;</p>

<p>Several of the convicts came out of the
cuddy by way of the companion-hatch and,
finding the poop a clear deck, began to play
at leap-frog and to gambol and hop and cut
capers with the grace of frisky cart-horses.
Their ugly faces and rowdy behaviour made
a slum or back alley of that white deck. The
beauty of the sea, the brilliance of the blue
heavens, the fiery sparkles and lights in the
polished brass and glass about the poop
vanished. Those tumbling convicts instantly
brought with them a flavour of London fog.
The air resounded with the cry of the costermonger;
an evil odour of decayed vegetables<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
attended them, and you seemed to hear the
music of the barrel-organ.</p>

<p>They came floundering and skylarking and
caper-cutting up to where Will and I were
standing; they gathered about us, and Will
was for moving off, but I held my ground; I
did not love their language, believe me, but
it would not do to seem shy of them. They
were flushed with drink, and talked rapidly
and thickly in the most intolerable, coarse
speech you can imagine; yet they were not
so drunk as to be unintelligible. Seemingly
they had been amongst the most successful
in plundering the cabins. One pulled out
Captain Sutherland&#8217;s gold watch, and, dangling
it on high by its chain as though playing
at bob-cherry, roared out: &#8216;This is the
thumble! Here&#8217;s the yack for a nob&#8217;s
gurrell!&#8217; Another produced a pin, a third a
large old-fashioned silver watch, which Will
whispered had belonged to the second mate.
Their talk was a compound of oaths and
thieves&#8217; slang, but they took not the least
notice of me or Will; they jabbered hoarsely
and thickly and swiftly amongst themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
as though on the eve of coming to blows,
breaking off presently, however, to watch the
long-boat rising out of her chocks when the
tackles were manned by some score or two of
felons.</p>

<p>The great boat was got over as smartly as
though all concerned in lifting and lowering
her were sailors. All necessary information
as to where stores, fresh water, and so forth
were to be found had doubtless been obtained
from Mr. Bates. Anyhow, no time had been
lost, but soon after the boat had been floated
a number of people, under the superintendence
of some of those men whom I had taken to
be the leaders, rolled a cask of fresh water,
a tierce or two of beef, two or three barrels
of flour and biscuit, and other matters which
my memory does not carry, to the open
gangway, and very rapidly all these things
were stored in the boat alongside.</p>

<p>Just then Tom came out of the cuddy by
way of the quarter-deck, and went to Bates
and Barney Abram, who stood together, with
whom he spoke. Tom, attended by Bates,
returned to the cuddy, and after an interval<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
reappeared with a sextant-case, a chart or
two, and such appliances as I supposed they
would need in the long-boat to enable them
to steer a course for land. These things
were handed down to some convicts who were
stowing the provisions in the boat. Tom
stood in the gangway and looked down, and
then called out for the oars, sail, and mast of
the boat to be brought along and shipped.
When he had seen to this, he glanced up, and,
observing me, ascended the poop-ladder.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hi!&#8217; said he, walking up to the group of
convicts, who had been talking and swearing
and boasting of their plunder, but were now
silent. &#8216;What are you doing here? This is
no part of the ship for you!&#8217; he cried, cursing
them. &#8216;Get away down to your quarters!
This poop is for the captain and the mate and
Mr. Abram, and the rest of us, who are responsible
for the safety of the vessel, and for
landing you where you may bolt and get
hanged at your leisure. Off with ye! Off
with ye!&#8217; And laying hold of the sturdiest he
gave him a thrust.</p>

<p>The convicts were used to this sort of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
usage, and probably would have recognised
no other treatment than that of kicks and
curses. They yielded as submissively as
felons to the command of an armed warder,
went in a body down the ladder, and mingled
with their fellows on the main-deck.</p>

<p>&#8216;Those people below must be sent adrift,&#8217;
said Tom, coming to my side and talking as
though he thought aloud. &#8216;It&#8217;s a hardship,
but I see the need. If they&#8217;re kept, they&#8217;ll
be murdered. They start well equipped&mdash;I&#8217;ve
seen to that. It&#8217;s odds if they&#8217;re not
picked up in a day or two, spite of our
friend Will&#8217;s misgivings. They&#8217;ll take three
boats from the ship. That&#8217;ll leave two and
the gig. The gig&#8217;s for us. The convicts
must see to themselves. It&#8217;s not a thing to be
debated. It&#8217;s every man for himself at such
times as these,&#8217; and his eye went to the stain
at the head of the poop-ladder where the
sentry had been butchered.</p>

<p>&#8216;Tom,&#8217; said I, &#8216;if the sailors are leaving
the ship, who&#8217;s to carry on the work?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Seven or eight rogues stay,&#8217; he answered.
&#8216;Four or five of the convicts have been to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
sea. With near two hundred and fifty souls
in the ship, I should be able to manage if I
chose to keep by her. How many of the
crew went to your complement?&#8217; said he,
turning to Will.</p>

<p>&#8216;Thirty, sir,&#8217; answered the lad.</p>

<p>&#8216;All told?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Thirty ordinary and able seamen and
idlers,&#8217; said Will.</p>

<p>&#8216;They looked a ruffianly lot!&#8217; exclaimed
Tom. &#8216;The people counted upon more help
than they got. Abram asked all hands to
remain; only seven or eight chums and acquaintances
of the prisoners stick to the ship.
Those were the scoundrels who flung themselves
upon the sentries. Yes, they&#8217;ll need
two quarter-boats besides the long-boat. A
numerous family to send afloat, and under the
line, too, with&mdash;how many women and children?&#8217;</p>

<p>Will gave him the number.</p>

<p>Tom made a grimace of pity, folded his
arms and stood, with a stern face, watching
what was happening in the gangway.</p>

<p>Mr. Bates was showing the convicts how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
to rig the accommodation-ladder over the
side. I looked at Tom, and particularly
noticed the change in his face, just as I had
felt and witnessed the change in his nature
and bearing. That change I had before
observed, but not so clearly. The light was
searching. He stood in repose, forgetting
himself and viewing the proceedings on the
main-deck. He was pale and thin and ill
and haggard, yet his manly beauty lacked
none of its old charms. Nay, there was a
gain, I thought. He seemed the handsomer
because of the severity of his expression.
There was a fierceness that gave his lineaments
a heroic cast. Suffering had deepened
and accentuated all that was manly in his
looks by an infusion of sternness that wanted
not in scorn and haughtiness.</p>

<p>When all was ready with the long-boat,
the armed convicts formed themselves into a
lane betwixt the open gangway and the
hatchway. They fell in with the precision
of soldiers to the cries which commanded
them, and stood erect and orderly, every
man letting the butt of his musket rest upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
the deck. A crowd of men, many of them
armed with the small-arms which they had
found in the ship, gathered around the main-hatch
and obstructed the view. A fellow,
with a fiddle in his hand, climbed on the bulwark-rail
close to the yawn of the gangway,
and putting the fiddle into his neck, screwed
out a tune. He was the convict who used to
play the prisoners round the decks at exercise.
When the mass of felons heard this
music, they burst into a great shout of
laughter. Such a wild, dreadful shout of
merriment has seldom gone up out of human
throats. The few remaining revellers in the
cuddy tumbled drunkenly out on the quarter-deck
on hearing the fiddle and the shouts,
and rent the air with another hideous burst
of laughter.</p>

<p>I heard a man bawl instructions down the
main-hatchway, but could not catch what he
said. Abram and some others roared out an
order for silence, and, tipsy as a number of
them were, as great a stillness fell upon the
convicts as ever had been observed in their
time of discipline.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>The first to come up was Doctor Russell-Ellice;
he was dressed as a convict, and I did
not recognise him until Will cried out. He
was immediately followed by Captain Sutherland,
who had also been forced into the felon&#8217;s
garb. Next came Captain Barrett, dressed as
a convict; then the sergeant and the soldiers
of the guard, most of whom were habited in
the prison apparel, though some were without
coats. Neither the doctor nor the officers
looked to right or left. They kept their eyes
fastened upon the deck, and so passed through
the rows of armed criminals to the gangway.
Nothing was to be heard but the insulting
squeaking music of the fiddle. The hush
upon the great throng of men made the scene
tragically impressive. I felt a deep pity for
Captain Sutherland, and asked Tom in a
whisper if his influence could not keep the
poor fellow on board that he might escape
with us if we got away; but Tom, without
looking at me, held up his hand to warn me
not to speak.</p>

<p>I went to the side and looked down at
the long-boat. She was a large, roomy fabric,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
and sat high and buoyant despite her liberal
equipment of food and water. These passed
into her: the surgeon, the commander of the
vessel, Captain Barrett, and eighteen soldiers,
two of their number having been killed.
They were all, as I have said, habited as
convicts; and now I observed the degrading
effect of the prison-dress upon the person,
for the doctor, Captain Barrett, and most of
the soldiers looked as sorry a set of rogues as
any that were in the ship, and needed but
irons and the barber to make you suppose
them criminals of the most desperate kind.</p>

<p>A pause in the proceedings happened
when the last of the soldiers had passed down
the ladder and entered the boat. Abram
shouted to the fiddler to stop his noise. So
great was the silence among the convicts that
everything said clearly reached the ear. The
prize-fighter went into the gangway and
looked over, and, turning to some of the
people whom I had taken to be among the
chiefs and ringleaders, called out: &#8216;There is
roob for as bady agaid.&#8217;</p>

<p>Tom and Will came to the rail and looked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
down at the boat. The doctor sat in the
stern-sheets with arms folded and head bowed.
He exhibited no signs of life. Captain
Sutherland&#8217;s posture was that of a crushed
and broken-hearted man. I grieved and
could have wept and entreated for the poor
fellow; he was a good, harmless sailor, an
excellent seaman, and his usage was barbarous,
seeing that the convicts had no other cause to
punish him and revenge themselves than his
being in command of the ship.</p>

<p>When Abram called out as I have just
said, Captain Barrett sprang to his feet and
shouted: &#8216;Where are my men&#8217;s wives and
children? You&#8217;re not going to send us adrift
without them, are you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;ll forward &#8217;eb od to you later!&#8217;
exclaimed Abram, turning his head without
turning his body and shouting with his
massive hand at the side of his mouth:
&#8216;Jodsud&#8217;&mdash;here he addressed a convict named
Johnson, one of several armed men who
guarded the entrance of the main-hatch; it
was this Johnson who had bawled down to
the doctor and others to come up&mdash;&#8216;there&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
roob for twedy bore id the lo&#8217;g boat! Call
&#8217;eb up!&#8217;</p>

<p>Tom made a stride to the head of the
poop-ladder, and, in a voice whose accents
rang through the ship like a volley of pistol
shots, shouted: &#8216;Hold! Abram, the next to
come up and enter the long-boat are the
women and children!&#8217;</p>

<p>The mass of convicts looked up at him;
indescribable was the effect of this universal
turning of faces one way.</p>

<p>&#8216;Dot lo&#8217;g ago you wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;ave anything
to do with this busidess!&#8217; shouted Abram
savagely. &#8216;What wasn&#8217;t your busidess thed
isd&#8217;t goi&#8217;g to be your busidess dow!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll have no discussion!&#8217; cried Tom with
the utmost ferocity. &#8216;I&#8217;m a man of my word.
Blood has been shed, and now you want to
round off the murders with the most hellish
piece of separation ever perpetrated on the
high seas. We have lived together,&#8217; he cried
to them all in clear, fierce, powerful tones,
&#8216;for many months, in the hulk and here, and
I know there are scores amongst you who
detest the thought of keeping poor women<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
and little children from their husbands, whose
sole offence has been their duty. Am I right?
You are under the influence of men who, as
your responsible leaders, elected by yourselves,
should be the last to advise you to
blacken yet what, God knows, is black
enough, by a fiendish act of brutality and
inhumanity!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We don&#8217;t want to be jawed,&#8217; bawled a
tipsy convict. &#8216;Better bring the doctor aboard
again if that&#8217;s to be the lay.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Butler,&#8217; shouted Abram, &#8216;I&#8217;b blowed if
you&#8217;re goi&#8217;g to have your way id everythi&#8217;g!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But I&#8217;ll have my way in this! I&#8217;ll have
my way in this!&#8217; cried Tom with a note of
madness in his voice and the look of a madman
in his face. &#8216;You begged me to take
charge. Fifty of you whined and petitioned
me, as the only navigator amongst you, to
command this ship if you seized her. And I
consented&mdash;on what terms? No cruelty, I
said, and safety for three friends. There&#8217;s to
be cruelty now&mdash;cruelty so hellish that the
vilest heart amongst you must sicken and
shrink if it will but give the intention a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
thought. You&#8217;re playing me false in this,
Abram. I say&mdash;don&#8217;t do it! Don&#8217;t do it!&#8217;
he cried, raising his voice and brandishing
his arms at the great mob below.</p>

<p>I glanced at the long-boat at this moment.
The doctor had pricked his ears and was
sitting looking up at the ship with a pale face
of astonishment. Captain Barrett, erect in
the boat, listened and stared. Captain Sutherland
repeated three or four times: &#8216;Who is it?
Who is it?&#8217; For Tom was not to be seen by
them; indeed, nobody was visible along the
whole line of the ship to those people low-seated
save Abram at the gangway and the
fiddler and me and Will at the rail.</p>

<p>Some fellow near the mainmast hoarsely
shouted: &#8216;Butler wants it all his own way.
Let him chuck it and rot! There&#8217;s Bates,
the mate of the ship. He&#8217;s be&#8217;n kep&#8217; to
oblige Butler. He&#8217;s a navigator. He&#8217;ll do
the trick.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No!&#8217; thundered Bates, roaring out as
though he were hailing the fore-topsail in a
gale of wind. &#8216;You&#8217;ve forced me into giving
orders, and I&#8217;m cursing myself for my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
cowardice. But so help me, you men, as I
stand here, one and all of you, good and bad,
drunk and sober, as you listen, sooner than
that you shall keep the women and children
on the chance of my taking Butler&#8217;s place,
you may now&mdash;now&mdash;now,&#8217; he roared, pointing
up, &#8216;turn to and reeve your yardarm
whip and run me aloft. D&#8217;ye hear me!
Now&mdash;<i>now</i>!&#8217; he screamed, in the extremity
of his wrath and resolution, and having
spoken he backed from the knot of convicts
out of the thick of whom he had exclaimed,
put his shoulders against the bulwark, folded
his arms and settled himself firmly on his legs
as a man prepared for the worst, and at that
instant he made as heroic a figure as Tom.</p>

<p>Silence followed. The hush was extraordinary.
The deep stillness that lay upon
the white ocean seemed to come into the ship
as a spirit. I saw that Abram was at a loss.
He looked savagely about him and made an
angry step or two as though he would pace
the deck. Tom, gripping the brass rail, kept
his eyes, full of fire, upon Abram; his breast
rose and fell violently with the vehemence of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
his breathing. Resolution as fearless and
magnificent as the chief mate had given expression
to was visible in his posture and
looks, and not the grossest and most ignorant
of the unhappy creatures who stared up could
have mistaken his mind.</p>

<p>He seemed to wait for Abram to speak,
then cried out, addressing the mass of men
generally: &#8216;Is it your wish that I should
navigate this ship and carry you to where we
shall presently decide?&#8217;</p>

<p>Most of the fellows stared at one another
like fools, as though they lacked courage to
answer.</p>

<p>&#8216;Answer me, any of you!&#8217; he shouted.
&#8216;Don&#8217;t think I care how it goes. Treat me
as you&#8217;ve dealt with those whose blood stains
these decks, and I&#8217;ll thank you. I&#8217;m a convict&mdash;the
most wretched of the wretches
among you&mdash;and broken-hearted as none of
you are. Use me as you will. But if I take
charge, I&#8217;m captain; and if I&#8217;m captain, my
will in what concerns the general safety is
law. The general safety will be imperilled
by the detention of the women and children.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
I, a fellow-convict and seaman, tell you this.
Now answer me: Am I in command or not?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It was settled!&#8217; howled Abram.</p>

<p>&#8216;Johnson!&#8217; cried Tom. &#8216;You at the
hatchway there! Order the women and
children on deck and pass them into the
boat!&#8217;</p>

<p>Johnson kept silent.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do what you&#8217;re told!&#8217; shouted a voice.
Then followed a hoarse, confused uproar from
fifty throats: &#8216;Get &#8217;em out of the ship!&#8217;
&#8216;Butler&#8217;s right! Who the plague wants to
keep them?&#8217; &#8216;It&#8217;ll lead to murder, and we
want our liberty ashore.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Order the women and children on deck!&#8217;
cried Tom; whereupon some man&mdash;but it was
not the convict Johnson&mdash;bellowed down the
main-hatch.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the women came up out
of the &#8217;tweendecks one by one, every woman
with a child in her arms, for there were eight
and eight, though every woman was not a
mother. The poor creatures&#8217; eyes were red
with weeping, their faces white with fear.
The husband of one of them had been killed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
that morning. They were dressed in bonnets
and shawls. My heart was cold as I watched
them. They went to the side and passed one
by one down the gangway ladder; the great
crowd of convicts looked on. Not a word
was uttered whilst the women walked through
the lane of armed men. As they entered the
boat, their husbands eagerly clasped and
kissed them and kissed the children; it was
like a meeting of the survivors of some
terrible disaster, and the tears stood in my
eyes.</p>

<p>The boat seemed crowded when the women
were in her, though, at a pinch, another ten
or twelve persons might have found space.</p>

<p>&#8216;Off with you dow and bake roob for the
other boats!&#8217; shouted Abram. &#8216;Head right
away and be th&#8217;kful you&#8217;ve falled idto the
&#8217;a&#8217;ds of hubade people! If you ha&#8217;g about
dear us, s&#8217;elp be Peter, we&#8217;ll fire idto you!&#8217;</p>

<p>A soldier seized an oar and shoved the
boat off. When she had gone clear by her
own length, the soldiers threw over the remaining
oars and began to row. It was
about one o&#8217;clock in the afternoon; a long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
morning had been spent in getting that big
boat out, storing, crowding, and sending her
adrift. I looked around the sea; not the
least breath of air anywhere dyed the molten
resplendent surface that brimmed in a breast
of delicate blue silver light into the morning
distances. The soldiers rowed vigorously, as
though all in the boat feared the convicts
would play them some murderous trick if
they hung within reach.</p>

<p>A number of people got on the line of
bulwark-rail and watched the boat as she
drew away. I had thought to hear a hundred
vile, blasphemous insults flung after her, but
nothing was said in that way. The fellows
laughed and talked and pointed, but no man
called out.</p>

<p>Barney Abram came on the poop, followed
by Mr. Bates, as though the mate had been
ordered to attend. The sweat was running
from the prize-fighter&#8217;s face, and the scars
about his brow and forehead were knitted
into a scowl. My heart beat fast. I dreaded
a quarrel between him and Tom, for Abram
swung the deadliest fist of any man in England.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
Greatly to my relief, however, spite of his
dark and sweating face, which seemed to give
the lie to his behaviour, his manner was
conciliatory.</p>

<p>&#8216;You shouldn&#8217;t lose your tepper so easily,
Butler,&#8217; said he. &#8216;What&#8217;s the good of exciti&#8217;g
yourself? You start this gentlebud off&#8217;&mdash;here
he motioned to Mr. Bates&mdash;&#8216;who talks a
lot of rot to the people about yardarbs. I
walked hib rou&#8217;d the deck to oblige you, that
the people bight see he&#8217;s by fr&#8217;e&#8217;d; and thed,
excited by you, he jaws theb about yardarbs.
If they had taken hib at his word!&#8217;
He looked up, and pointing, exclaimed with
his extraordinary smirking grin: &#8216;That&#8217;s
what I thi&#8217;k you gentlebud of the sea call
a yardarb. Gallus high, ain&#8217;t it, by rosebud?&#8217;
And he turned his fiery black eyes
upon me.</p>

<p>&#8216;The women are safe, and I&#8217;m satisfied,&#8217;
answered Tom. &#8216;Abram, I had looked for
more humanity at your hands. You&mdash;a man
of your reputation,&#8217; he added, with an angry,
sarcastic smile that instantly faded, &#8216;to truckle
to such beasts as we&#8217;ve had to live amongst<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
ever since we&#8217;ve found ourselves together in
irons; but the matter&#8217;s ended,&#8217; he exclaimed,
with a sort of sudden bustle and hurry in his
manner. &#8216;Let&#8217;s get the other boats away.
There&#8217;s a destination to be settled and arrangements
for working the ship to be made. This
weather is good for talk, but it may change
in an hour.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Right,&#8217; exclaimed Abram. &#8216;Bates, call
up your bed and give your orders.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Captain Butler,&#8217; exclaimed the poor mate,
&#8216;let me leave this ship with the crew.&#8217;</p>

<p>Abram fiercely rounded upon him. &#8216;Is
this your gratitude?&#8217; he exclaimed in his
thick stunted accents. &#8216;Didn&#8217;t I tell you,
Butler, he wasn&#8217;t to be trusted? Wolves
tear hib! Why don&#8217;t the flat-catcher dow
whed he&#8217;s well off?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re here and you&#8217;ll remain here,
Bates,&#8217; said Tom, giving the unfortunate man
an expressive look. &#8216;Get those two quarter-boats
alongside and have them provisioned,
and let me advise you to take a sheepshank
in your tongue.&#8217;</p>

<p>Mr. Bates went to the rail and called to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
the men. Some seamen and convicts came
tumbling on to the poop.</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;ve got hib and we&#8217;ll keep hib,&#8217; said
Abram, pulling off the captain&#8217;s cap and
wiping his brow with the captain&#8217;s pocket-handkerchief,
and straddling in front of Tom,
a massive, terrible figure. &#8216;Butler, you was
right. I&#8217;ve beed turdi&#8217;g it over. You card&#8217;t
be singleadded. Suppose you should die.
We&#8217;d let hib understa&#8217;d what betrayal &#8217;ud
cost. But what&#8217;s the good of getti&#8217;g excited?

by tepper&#8217;&mdash;and here he spoke with his eyes

<small>SHE LISTENS TO THE CONVICTS DEBATING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> and the prize-fighter talked together
whilst Mr. Bates got the boats alongside and
superintended the stowage of provisions and
water in them. I went into the shadow of
the awning to get out of the heat of the sun
and to remove myself from Tom, that we
might not be seen together constantly. Some
of the ringleaders, as I must term the fellows
whom the convicts undoubtedly regarded as
heads or chiefs under Tom or Abram, joined
my sweetheart and the prize-fighter, and the
air speedily hummed with the eager, animated
talk of the crowd. Will joined me, and we
watched the long-boat. She had gone about
a mile, and they had hoisted the sail for the
shelter of its shadow. It hung like a sheet of
silver from its yard, without a stir, so smooth
was the sea, so still the air. The soldiers continued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
to sweep the boat along; the oars
glanced like hairs of silver as they rose
and fell.</p>

<p>Will went to the binnacle to judge of
the course the boat was making. The
scoundrel seaman who grasped the wheel
growled out with a low, coarse laugh and
in a cursing voice some remark I did not
catch.</p>

<p>&#8216;You wouldn&#8217;t have said that yesterday,&#8217;
exclaimed Will, and came back to me without
taking further notice of the miscreant. &#8216;They
are heading due west,&#8217; said he. &#8216;I don&#8217;t suppose
they will make up their minds till the
other boats join them.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What is the nearest land?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The Brazilian coast. But the nearest is
a long way off. There&#8217;s but a small chance
for them outside of being picked up. And
yet what a lump of a boat she is compared
with the gig! When is she to be provisioned?
And when are we to get away? And when
we&#8217;ve got away, what&#8217;s going to happen?
Good angels, I wish we were both at Stepney!&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>&#8216;Leave everything to Tom,&#8217; said I, &#8216;and
do as he tells you.&#8217;</p>

<p>He looked at me with a mutinous eye,
went to the rail and stared over the side.
Tom and the council of convicts had left the
poop. I peered through the skylight; the
cuddy was empty, the table covered with
fragments and remains of food with broken
china and broken bottles and glasses, and the
deck scarcely fit to walk on for the wounding
stuff that strewed it. I went to the break of
the poop to see what they were about on the
main-deck. Both quarter-boats were alongside
and a gang of convicts were stowing them.
The decks were filled with the people, who,
since the departure of the long-boat, had
grown orderly. The mass of them conversed
in knots; groups hung about the galleys.
They had discovered pipes and tobacco&mdash;tobacco
there would be in plenty for the
guard and the crew, and possibly a stock of
pipes. A number of the convicts had pipes
in their mouths, and their profound enjoyment
of the tobacco, after months and, perhaps,
years of penitential abstinence, undoubtedly
helped to keep them quiet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>The sun stood something to the left of
north, and the tall, motionless spaces of
canvas on high cast shadows over the decks,
and betwixt the rails the high noon was
endurable. A thick, sickly smell of roasted
paint rose from the ship&#8217;s side. If you put
your hand upon the exposed wood or any
piece of metal, you were burnt as though you
touched hot iron. I thought to myself: If
these unhappy wretches should run short of
water! If this calm should hold them motionless
here for days and perhaps for weeks!
For calms often serve ships so in these parts,
as I had heard my father and his sea friends
tell. I sought to compute the number on
board, and, allowing for those who were
presently to leave the ship, I calculated we
should muster hard upon two hundred and
fifty souls. When Tom left them, what would
the miserable creatures do? But, then, what
was that to me? All I cared for was that
Tom should come off with his life and be a
free man, no longer a degraded criminal,
clanking in irons, to be mangled by the cat,
perhaps, at the will of any ferocious Tasmanian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
ruffian who might take a dislike to
him. The convicts had seized the ship. One
had but to look toward the now distant long-boat
to appreciate the felons&#8217; estimate of
human life. I could not pity them when I
thought of how they would have kept the
women and children and of the havoc they
had wrought below, and when I looked at
their faces, recalled their songs and oaths in
drink, their bestial speech, and saw the
plunder on their vile backs.</p>

<p>Tom and Abram and a little crowd of men
stood near the gangway. My sweetheart
looked on. He gave no orders. Poor Mr.
Bates did all the work of superintendence,
and watched the convicts as they slung the
provisions and water for the seamen into the
quarter-boats. When this work was ended,
some cries were raised; the throngs of people
gathered about the main-hatch and filled the
quarter-deck; the armed malefactors formed
a lane as before, but this time the fiddler
did not make his appearance.</p>

<p>A hoarse voice at the main-hatch summoned
the fellows below to come up, and one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
after another the crew arrived. The huge
one-eared boatswain, with his staring, glassy
eyes, scowled round him with daring, defiant
looks. Abram stood in the gangway and
he halted every man ere passing him over the
side to say: &#8216;You cad stop with us if you like.
We&#8217;re short of worki&#8217;g &#8217;a&#8217;ds and we&#8217;ll treat
you as one of us. What&#8217;ll you do?&#8217;</p>

<p>Mr. Balls made no answer; he passed
sullenly on; so did the sailmaker and carpenter.
Mr. Stiles, with a bewildered look at
the convicts and then through the gangway
at the white gleam of sea visible there, wiped
his face on the sleeve of his convict jacket
and said: &#8216;Where might you be bound to,
sir?&#8217;</p>

<p>Some one cried out: &#8216;That bloke was the
ship&#8217;s steward. He&#8217;s of no use.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Over you go,&#8217; said Abram, giving Mr.
Stiles a dab with his immense hand between
his shoulder-blades, and the steward went
with a run to the gangway and disappeared
down the ladder.</p>

<p>Two of the sailors agreed to remain. Will,
who had come to my side, told me that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
were the poorest, most skulking and worthless
of the forecastle hands. The convicts, however,
cheered when these fellows said they
would stay, and the armed men opened to let
them pass into the crowd. Will&#8217;s fellow-apprentices
looked up at him as they went to
the boat, and one made a face as though to
express his disgust at what he took to be my
cousin&#8217;s disloyalty or cowardice. I marked
the effect of this upon Will, and grasped him
by the arm, whispering passionately: &#8216;Not a
word!&#8217; and knew by the working of his face
that I was just in time to arrest some angry
protesting sentence that might have endangered
him and me too.</p>

<p>Whilst the seamen filed through the
gangway, I chanced to look down upon a
crowd of convicts on the quarter-deck, and
spied a fellow pick another man&#8217;s pocket.
He did it with admirable nimbleness and
dexterity. Both men, the thief and the
victim, were dressed in Lieutenant Chimmo&#8217;s
clothes. The man that was robbed was the
rogue who had held up Captain Sutherland&#8217;s
gold watch and chain as though he meant to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
play at bob-cherry, and it was this watch and
chain which the other sneaked with inimitable
adroitness.</p>

<p>I supposed no one but myself saw this;
many stood about, close, too, and the fellow
stole the watch with the most foolish, staring,
innocent face you could imagine, looking at
the seamen going through the gangway as
though he could think of nothing else. But
scarcely had he snugged the watch and chain
in his side-pocket, when another convict next
him whipped it out with incredible skill and
swiftness. Indeed, I should not have remarked
the motions of the rogue&#8217;s hand but for the
gleam of the gold. A minute later, the first
convict put his hand to his pocket and missed
the watch. He turned furiously upon the
second convict, shouting: &#8216;A thief! A thief!&#8217;
for all the world as though he had been some
respectable man in the streets just robbed.
The felon who had the watch roared out: &#8216;A
thief! A thief!&#8217; and fell upon the second
convict whose pocket he had picked. A
scuffle followed. The second convict, whose
guilt appeared to be assumed by all who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
stood near, as though they knew him as a
thief without morals and capable of robbing
a brother-thief, was kicked and beaten, and a
mob of shouting convicts, with this rascal in
the midst of them, surged forward, and I took
notice that the rogue who shouted the loudest
and kicked the hardest was the fellow who
had the watch.</p>

<p>This commotion caused no uneasiness
amongst the crowd who stood on the side
of the deck where the open gangway was.
No doubt they understood what had happened,
and guessed that enough were concerned
in the scuffle to insure justice being
done.</p>

<p>By this time both quarter-boats were filled
with the seamen. I dare say there were
eleven or twelve men in each, and more could
not have gone without peril, for they were small
boats, though they were stout and fairly new.
Bates had seen that each craft had its proper
equipment of mast, sail, oars, rudder, and the
like. One of the ringleaders, a sallow-faced
convict with a hare-lip and but two or three
fangs in his upper jaw, roared down to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
seamen to shove off, and in a few minutes
both boats were heading in the direction of
the long-boat, which had come to a stand
awaiting them. Many convicts sprang upon
the bulwarks and howled out insults in the
wickedest language of the slums, in the most
revolting speech of the great city rookeries
and haunts of sin and infamy. The seamen
rowed away in silence.</p>

<p>Tom came on to the poop and looked at
me a little while with a face of grief and
horror, as though his very soul shrank up
within him, to think that I should be a spectator
of such scenes and a hearer of such
language. I read his mind; he would not
approach me to speak.</p>

<p>Barney Abram followed, and with him
were the hare-lipped man and some score of
convicts, of whom half might have been
principals in the seizure of the ship.</p>

<p>&#8216;Let&#8217;s get to busidess,&#8217; said Abram. &#8216;Talk
to the people as was arradged, Butler.&#8217;</p>

<p>On this, Tom, laying hold of the brass
rail, leaned forward and cried out that every
man was to come together on the quarter-deck,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
as he had a few words to say to them.
Mr. Bates stole up the ladder to my side and,
without speaking, gazed with a look of bitter
distress at the receding boats. Still was the
ocean as polished a plain as ever it had been
during the morning. The sun flashed up the
water into blinding dazzle in the north-west,
and the heat was terrible. There was no
motion in the ship to fan the lightest of the topmost
cloths; the atmosphere floated like the
breath of an oven, without refreshment of the
draughts which circle about a deck when the
becalmed craft leans with the swell and her
courses and topsails swing. The convicts
massed themselves upon the main-deck; their
faces were white or scarlet with the heat.
The drink had been distilled out of them by the
roasting temperature, and the unhappy beings
stood looking up at Tom with as orderly a
bearing as ever they exhibited when the
doctor addressed them.</p>

<p>&#8216;Men,&#8217; said my sweetheart, &#8216;I&#8217;ve taken
charge of this vessel. It&#8217;s the interests of
everybody aboard her that I&#8217;ve now to consider;
it&#8217;s for us, all assembled as we are,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
to consider what&#8217;s to be done. And first
understand this: No ship can be sailed without
discipline. Look aloft, men, at those vast
heights. You see for yourselves what a complicated
thing a ship is. If I and the mate of
your own election,&#8217; and here he pointed to
Mr. Bates, &#8216;give an order, it must be promptly
obeyed. If not&mdash;but you&#8217;re not fools&mdash;you
can guess what must follow if we&#8217;re not
obeyed. I&#8217;ll not interfere in any arrangements
which don&#8217;t affect the safety of the
ship. You&#8217;ll sleep where you choose, and eat
when you choose, and whatever you do that
doesn&#8217;t concern our lives will be no business
of mine. But remember, there are nearly two
hundred and fifty of us!&#8217;</p>

<p>He was interrupted by some voice shouting
out the exact number.</p>

<p>&#8216;You taste this weather, don&#8217;t ye? You
can guess how it would fare with us to run
short of water, and next to that would be the
running short of provisions. You must be
willing to go on allowance.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Willing? Of course. That&#8217;s to be
expected,&#8217; broke in three or four of them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>&#8216;Those amongst you who have been seafaring
men will unite with the sailors and
form a crew and take the forecastle for
your quarters, which must be your own,
never to be intruded upon. Is that understood?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Understood!&#8217; was the answer, in a roar.</p>

<p>&#8216;The rest will form themselves into three
watches under heads, as in the doctor&#8217;s time;
and every watch will come on deck turn and
turn about, and stand by to assist the crew
by pulling and hauling, cleaning and making
the ship sweet, and so helping to keep you
all alive, ready for the run ashore when the
hour comes.&#8217;</p>

<p>A great cheer echoed this sentence.</p>

<p>&#8216;Mr. Bates,&#8217; continued Tom, &#8216;knows where
everything is stowed in this ship. He&#8217;ll
sample your food for you and name you your
water allowance. Use him kindly, men. He&#8217;s
of first-rate consequence to us.&#8217;</p>

<p>When this was said, Barney Abram crossed
to the mate, brought him to the middle of the
break of the poop, near to where Tom stood,
and there, in the sight of all the convicts,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
shook him by the hand. This was done in
silence, but it was a very expressive performance&mdash;some
might hold after the Eastern
manner, seeing who was the main actor.</p>

<p>Tom went on: &#8216;I must have the captain&#8217;s
cabin; the navigating instruments of
the vessel are there and certain conveniences
of furniture. The chief mate will also need
his cabin; he&#8217;ll share it with that young
gentleman,&#8217; said he, pointing to Will. &#8216;If
any of you in the hurry of this morning has
mistaken Mr. Bates&#8217;s effects for Captain
Barrett&#8217;s or the other officers&#8217; or the commander&#8217;s,
I&#8217;ll beg him to return them. He
is our friend, and Mr. Abram wishes him to
be well used. It is not right he should be
thus dressed.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Look at yourself?&#8217; cried a voice on the
quarter-deck.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, but I&#8217;m a convict!&#8217; exclaimed Tom,
savagely.</p>

<p>This raised a roar; a hundred men seemed
to speak at once; they yelled out to this
effect&mdash;that there were no longer any convicts
aboard that ship, that they were all free men,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
that they had got their liberty and meant to
keep it, and so forth.</p>

<p>&#8216;Order!&#8217; bawled Abram, raising his arms
above his head. &#8216;We&#8217;re here to discuss
batters quietly. The capt&#8217;id&#8217;s talked very
sensibly, ad I&#8217;b with hib up to the hilt as far
as he&#8217;s gord. Are those your sedibents?&#8217;
said he, looking round at the little crowd of
convicts who stood near.</p>

<p>&#8216;There must be discipline,&#8217; answered one
of them, &#8216;and Butler&#8217;s talked very good sense
so far.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How about the stock of spirits?&#8217; exclaimed
a tall, thin, pale, grey-haired convict,
dressed in an officer&#8217;s shell-jacket too short
for him&mdash;so that when I think of him now it
is always somehow in connection with Mr.
Dickens&#8217;s incomparable figure of Smike.
&#8216;&#8217;Sponsible men are wanted to see to that.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re right, Williams,&#8217; said Tom, giving
him an emphatic nod.</p>

<p>&#8216;Every cask of spirits,&#8217; continued the man,
speaking somewhat nasally and amidst a
silence that might have rendered his voice
audible as far as the forecastle, &#8216;is full of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
little devils swimming about. And every
little devil, when he&#8217;s swallowed, carries
seven other little devils, all a-clinging to one
another&#8217;s tails, down into a man&#8217;s inside.
Call it eight devils,&#8217; said he, raising his voice.
&#8216;One for each eye, is two; one for each ear,
is four; one for the tongue&#8217;s, five; and there&#8217;s
three over to keep the others goin&#8217; it.
&#8217;Sponsible men, Abram, if that there sea
is not to shut up this pleasing dream of
liberty.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Men,&#8217; said Tom, &#8216;there&#8217;s sound reason in
what you&#8217;ve heard. But I spy good sense
breaking out amongst you all. Don&#8217;t let your
feelings carry you away. Look at the mess
in the cuddy! What good has your drunken,
breaking scramble done? The sober and
sound amongst you should compel the men
who smashed up that pleasant interior to
clear it out, and to make it a shipshape abode
for those whose quarters it&#8217;s to become.&#8217;</p>

<p>Some one shouted: &#8216;We&#8217;ll have that
done!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Dow talk to us about where we&#8217;re to go,&#8217;
said Abram.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>&#8216;Talk to me, and I&#8217;ll advise you,&#8217; said
Tom, with his eyes upon the crowd beneath,
folding his arms and standing erect.</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re a navigator and know the world,&#8217;
exclaimed the sallow, ill-looking man with
the hare-lip.</p>

<p>&#8216;Aye, and I&#8217;ll counsel you when you&#8217;ve
spoken and want advice,&#8217; said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8216;Where are we now?&#8217; exclaimed a convict
on the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>&#8216;Shall I give it to you in parallels and
meridians?&#8217; answered Tom, with a sort of
angry scorn in his voice. &#8216;You wouldn&#8217;t
understand me. Suppose Mr. Bates brings
you up a chart, there&#8217;s no room for hard upon
two hundred and fifty heads to overhang it
at once; and how many of you can read,
that it should be passed around? Now listen:
We&#8217;re in the middle of the ocean to the north
of the Equator. Yonder,&#8217; said he, pointing
over the port beam, &#8216;many hundred leagues
distant, is the Gulf of Guinea and the great
bight of the African coast from Cape Formosa
to Cape Frio.&#8217;</p>

<p>The convicts turned their heads all one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
way, staring like one man, some of them
getting on their toes to look.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yonder,&#8217; continued Tom, pointing over
the starboard beam, whereupon the heads of
the convicts went round as before and all the
poor, ignorant wretches stared as though by
looking they&#8217;d see the land, &#8216;is the great
Brazilian seaboard from Cape St. Roque to
Rio Janeiro.&#8217;</p>

<p>I observed that Abram gazed at Tom with
an indescribable smirking grin of admiration,
as though struck by his familiar acquaintance
with land entirely out of sight.</p>

<p>&#8216;But my words,&#8217; continued my sweetheart
&#8216;give only a few who are educated amongst
you any ideas. Yet I can tell you no more
than this: That we are in the heart of the
great Atlantic Ocean, and that a huge world
for choice is spread on either hand, away in
the Pacific by rounding Cape Horn and away
in the Indian and Southern Oceans by rounding
the Cape of Good Hope. Where shall I carry
you to?&#8217;</p>

<p>A number of the convicts spoke at once.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>&#8216;Wud at a tibe! Wud at a tibe!&#8217; yelled
Abram.</p>

<p>&#8216;Let&#8217;s go home!&#8217; shouted a man on the
quarter-deck.</p>

<p>&#8216;Debate it,&#8217; said Abram.</p>

<p>An uneasy stir ran through the mass
of the convicts, and a long, deep growl of
dissent.</p>

<p>&#8216;Home!&#8217; cried Tom, passionately. &#8216;How&#8217;s
home called in English? What&#8217;s its name?
Is it Newgate or Millbank or her Majesty&#8217;s
ship <i>Warrior</i>? Is it the Dockyard and the
Arsenal and irons and handcuffs, cursing
warders and carbines ready for your brains?
You want my advice; I&#8217;ll counsel you.&#8217;</p>

<p>Some angry laughter broke from the men.</p>

<p>&#8216;Who&#8217;s the madman that talks of home?&#8217;
shouted Tom. &#8216;Shall I sail you up the
Thames and moor ye alongside the hulk?
Is Plymouth your port, or do you choose
Portsmouth?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why not try for the islands about Torres
Straits?&#8217; exclaimed one of the convicts who
had been a seaman. Several bawled to know
where Torres Straits were.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>&#8216;To the nor&#8217;ard of Australia,&#8217; replied the
convict. &#8216;There the sea&#8217;s thick with islands.
Plenty to eat and drink, mates, and casting
away a ship is as easy and safe as drawing a
cork.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ain&#8217;t Norfold Island hard by?&#8217; exclaimed
another.</p>

<p>&#8216;My idea,&#8217; said a ringleader, raising his
voice as he overhung the poop-rail, &#8216;is to
beach the vessel on the West Coast of Africa.
There we breaks up into parties and disperses,
and every party has their yarn ready
manufactured to account for theirselves
ag&#8217;in&#8217; being met with or falling in with a
settlement.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Were you ever ashore on that coast?&#8217;
exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; answered the man.</p>

<p>&#8216;Then put this picture before you, one
and all, for I who address you know what I
am saying: Not a patch of verdure; leagues
of sand like glass, glaring and shining; a few
half-starved jackals; a few bushmen, who
live on beetles and putrefied seals and go
clothed in stinking sheepskins; a hare or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
two at long intervals, and a few sand-plants;
the sun at noon like a lantern looming in
vapours; here and there penguins braying;
here and there sea-fowls shrieking, and the
surf roaring always. Is that good enough for
you? You&#8217;d be clean-picked bones in a week.&#8217;</p>

<p>All this while the ocean remained breathless.
Far away were the two black specks
of quarter-boats, and beyond was the gleam
of the long-boat&#8217;s sail, a point of light under
the horizon like the image of a star. Fortunately
for the convicts, the lay of the yards
flung the shadow of the canvas upon the
deck. Otherwise it was broiling where the
sun was. The poop was sheltered by the
awning that stretched from the mizzen-mast
to the brass rail. Many of the people stood
with their coats over their arms and their
shirts open. A mist rose from them. I
figured how it had been at night in their
quarters when I saw that mist and the
motionless wind-sails and the main-hatch half
sealed with its cage-like barricade.</p>

<p>&#8216;May I speak?&#8217; cried a man on the
quarter-deck, lifting up his hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>&#8216;To the poi&#8217;t,&#8217; answered Abram. &#8216;Every
bad with ad idea bay speak; but to the
poi&#8217;t.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Here&#8217;s a big ship,&#8217; said the man, in a
very fair cultivated accent (he was about
six-and-twenty years of age, had held a
situation as a clerk and had been sentenced
for forgery), &#8216;and we&#8217;re a numerous and
powerful company of determined men, needing
nothing but the organisation that Captain
Butler&#8217;s capable of. I propose that we chase
small vessels and capture them, send their
crews adrift like those yonder, man each captured
craft with a number of ourselves, every
lot containing a proportion of those who are
sailors or who have followed the sea. This
would disperse us. Every crew would do as
they thought proper with their own craft. I
should be for wrecking mine on some safe
coast near a town where we could represent
ourselves as castaways.&#8217;</p>

<p>The convicts listened with close attention.
Abram looked at Tom, who made no sign.</p>

<p>&#8216;What d&#8217;ye say to it, Butler?&#8217; shouted a
fellow.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>&#8216;Do what you please,&#8217; answered my
sweetheart.</p>

<p>&#8216;Advise us,&#8217; said the hare-lipped man.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s a landlubber&#8217;s fancy,&#8217; said Tom.</p>

<p>A number of men talked at once. One
of the original crew of the <i>Childe Harold</i>
roared out: &#8216;It&#8217;s smothering rot! The
capt&#8217;n&#8217;s laughing at you! Chase! In a
craft arter this pattern, with twelve or
fourteen hands and a working crew, ne&#8217;er
a great gun nor a soul saving the capt&#8217;n
and the mate as &#8217;ud be capable of navigating
them small craft after they was boarded and
taken!&#8217; He spat hard and turned his back
in contempt.</p>

<p>&#8216;My notion&#8217;s been this all through the
blushen piece,&#8217; said a beetle-browed, flat-nosed,
ruffianly looking convict. &#8216;Sail to
an oninhabited hisland and settle him. A
hisland where there&#8217;s grub agoing in fruit-trees
and beastesses of fish what crawls upon
the beach, all which there&#8217;ll be some here as
has heard of. Where water trickles sweet
an&#8217; cold, and the weather it ain&#8217;t too hot.
There, upon that hisland, we can concoct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
and consart, and them what pleases can be
took off by passing vessels. The others will
be a-doing as did them mutineers of the
<i>Bounty</i> whose capt&#8217;n he was named Bligh.
We moors this ship and keeps her handy.
Females ain&#8217;t ever fur to look for. In this
&#8217;ere ship wives can be brought from places
which ain&#8217;t too fur off and where the colour
won&#8217;t be wrong, the &#8217;igh seas being vide of
choice. That&#8217;s bin my notion all through the
fired piece.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Who&#8217;s next?&#8217; shouted Abram, impatiently.</p>

<p>One of the remaining crew of the ship&mdash;a
sailor with a cast eye and a head of hair
so exactly resembling oakum that no convict
could look at it without finding something
personal and a sort of reflection in it&mdash;this
man, who sat high-perched above the heads
of the throng on the quarter-deck winch,
snapped his fingers at the poop and asked
leave to address the gents.</p>

<p>&#8216;What d&#8217;ye want to say?&#8217; shouted the
hare-lipped man, who, I gathered, ranked
next to Abram as the principal ringleader.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>&#8216;Gents, all,&#8217; cried the fellow, &#8216;man an&#8217;
boy, I&#8217;ve followed the seas for two and
twenty years, and in that time I&#8217;ve sailed
all about the world and there&#8217;s scarce a
furrin part as I haven&#8217;t visited. Now, if I
was you, speaking with Captain Butler&#8217;s good
leave, what I&#8217;d do&#8217;s this: Round the Horn
t&#8217;other side of South Amerikay there lies
what&#8217;s called the Narth Pacific Ocean. From
the Sandwich Islands, right away to this side
the Philippines, including of the Ladrones and
the Caroline Islands, it&#8217;s all chock-a-block
with the sort of little countries ye oughter
visit. A lovely cordial drink they manufactures
out of cocoanut juice. There&#8217;s no
call for clothes. The natives are friendly
disposed. Them as ain&#8217;t are easily knocked
over the head. White men like yourselves
live in them islands. If I was you gents, I&#8217;d
get Captain Butler to steer the ship into the
Narth Pacific, touch and discharge a score
of ye, touch and discharge another score,
touch and touch again till this here multitude
was broke up. That&#8217;s my notion, gents, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
your chance, and I&#8217;ll ask Captain Butler what
he thinks.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;ll do!&#8217; exclaimed Tom. &#8216;I would
propose nothing better.&#8217;</p>

<p>On this there was some confusion, owing
to a number of the convicts cheering, whilst
others shouted questions to the poop. The
silence upon the sea, and the ship lying as
stirless as though she were at anchor, made
this strange council of convicts somewhat
ironical to my mind. It was hard to cast
one&#8217;s eye over the lake-like ocean and realise
the North Pacific as a part of the world that
was to be come at by the vessel. Tom&#8217;s
approval of the seaman&#8217;s scheme seemed to
settle the matter. Many questions, most of
them ignorant and ridiculous, were bawled.
They were answered from the poop, sometimes
by Tom, sometimes by Abram and the
ringleaders, and sometimes they were answered
by fellows on the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>After a little, and whilst the decks were
a-buzz with the vast noise of talk, the prize-fighter
asked Mr. Bates to produce a chart of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
the islands named by the seaman. Mr. Bates
fetched a chart. It was a big sheet with a
blue back, comprised a portion only of the
North Pacific, and was very clearly drawn and
printed. This chart was laid upon the skylight
and the corners weighted. The principal
convicts drew in a body to it.</p>

<p>I stood near and overheard the talk.
They called up the sailor, and he pointed to
three or four of the islands which he said he
had visited. The hare-lipped man asked him
if British ships of war cruised in those seas.
He answered that here and there a small
surveying-vessel might be fallen in with, &#8216;but
nothen to take notice of,&#8217; said he, &#8216;nothen
that&#8217;s going to hurt ye. It&#8217;s your best
chance, gents. Many sorts of vessels are
a-touching at them islands for water, nuts,
and sometimes for their entertainment, and
often again for their convenience. The sailors
run, &#8217;specially from the South Seamen. You&#8217;ll
have your yarns ready in case of questions;
but down in them parts curiosity ain&#8217;t what
you might call active. Stick to this here
scheme, and there&#8217;s nothen to hinder any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
man as has a mind to retarn home from
finding himself arter a year or two in Lunnon
again, with dollars enough in his pocket to
keep him in wittles till something turns
up.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;All that this man says is very true,&#8217; exclaimed
Tom. &#8216;He&#8217;s given us a good scheme.
We&#8217;re obliged to him.&#8217;</p>

<p>Saying this, he edged out of the crowd
about the skylight and, seeing me abreast of
the rail, came and stood beside me.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is it a good scheme?&#8217; I whispered,
without looking at him.</p>

<p>&#8216;It will amuse them,&#8217; he answered softly.
&#8216;I must seem in earnest. What do I care?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You control them wonderfully.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Poor wretches!&#8217; he muttered, and, stepping
to the companion-way, took the ship&#8217;s
telescope out of its brackets and pointed it at
the three boats upon the sea. Their situation
was now determinable to the naked eye
by the dim, tiny gleam of the long-boat&#8217;s sail.</p>

<p>&#8216;They&#8217;re sneaking westward,&#8217; said Tom,
talking low with his eye at the glass. &#8216;The
American seaboard may give me the chance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
I want. Eastward nearly everything afloat is
British&mdash;curse the name!&#8217;</p>

<p>By this time, the convicts on the quarter-deck
had got wind of the chart on the poop
and were crowding up the ladders to look.
That all might obtain a sight, Abram bawled
a recommendation to them to form themselves
into small divisions. This was done. The
chiefs or ringleaders broke up the mass into
little gangs, and one after another these gangs
came to the skylight and overhung the chart.
The cast-eyed sailor with the hair of oakum
stood by to answer questions and pointed out
the islands. Some of the educated convicts
dwelt upon the chart so long, musing, running
their fingers down the meridians, calculating
distances and so forth, that the waiting
gangs howled at them with impatience. Yet
all was now orderly as one could wish&mdash;far
more orderly than I had dared expect.</p>

<p>As the gangs passed on from the skylight
aft, viewing the chart and questioning the
cast-eyed man, they broke up and hung
about various parts of the poop or returned
to the main-deck. The coarse joke, the loud,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
brutal laugh was frequent; but there was no
horse-play, none of the former huge, hideous,
cart-horse gambolling, shouting, and tipsy
fighting. The heat lay upon the people like
a weight. Their spirits were sobered by the
extraordinary oppression of the vast, silent,
roasting calm.</p>

<p>&#8216;Abram,&#8217; called Tom, holding the telescope
and still standing at my side, &#8216;let some
of the men&mdash;those responsible for the mess&mdash;clean
the cuddy out. Look through the
skylight. The deck&#8217;s full of broken glass.
And my advice to you and the others is to
arrange without delay for the distribution of
the people for the night. You&#8217;ll want cooks.
Those who have been cooking so far should
continue. They know what&#8217;s needed, where
to seek, how to manage. Mr. Bates here will
counsel you on quantities. I wish to see the
ship cleared fore and aft, and everything
ready for any sort of weather that may come
along. Ay, and there&#8217;s more yet. Suppose
an English man-of-war heaves in sight and
signals us, we must know what to do and be
in readiness to do it. The pennant&#8217;s an old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
cure for dull sight. A devilish keen eye
that never winks lies spliced in the fly of
every man-of-war&#8217;s whip. And d&#8217;ye see that,
Abram?&#8217; he cried, pointing at the sea over
the starboard quarter.</p>

<p>Twenty or thirty convicts were upon
the poop, and they all turned their heads
and stared in a hurrying, eager way in the
direction indicated by Tom&#8217;s levelled forefinger.</p>

<p>&#8216;See what?&#8217; exclaimed the prize-fighter,
lifting the sharp of his massive hand to his
brow, and straining his black, fiery vision.</p>

<p>&#8216;That dark blue line.&#8217;</p>

<p>Tom stepped to the rail and cried out:
&#8216;Stand by, all you seamen aboard this
vessel, to trim sail!&#8217; Then turning to
Abram: &#8216;Tumble the people to their work
of cleaning up, will ye?&#8217; he cried. &#8216;Put the
cooks to their duty; we can&#8217;t starve!&#8217; He
then turned to me and, placing the telescope
in my hand, said loudly: &#8216;Marlowe, replace
this, then go to your berth and carry what
belongs to you to my cabin, and wait for
me there.&#8217;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXVI<br />


<small>SHE SUPS WITH HER SWEETHEART</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I went</span> quickly, that the people might see how
smartly I obeyed the new captain. A few
convicts roamed about the cuddy, staring as
though out of curiosity into the plundered
berths and at the decorations and lamps, and
needlessly crushing the broken glass into the
carpet as they walked. I stepped warily and
got to my berth, unlocked the door, and found
all right within. I could not help reflecting
upon what had passed since I was last here;
it seemed a week since I was in this berth, so
violent, hurried, and numerous had been
the incidents of that day.</p>

<p>I made one bundle of my woman&#8217;s attire,
the other clothes and a few toilet things, and
went to the captain&#8217;s cabin. Then, thought I,
I shall want a mattress to lie on, so I fetched
the convict&#8217;s mattress, pillow and blanket, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
shut the door and sat down to wait for Tom,
no one during these journeys having taken
the least notice of me.</p>

<p>It was horribly hot, and I opened the
large circular port and leaned with my head
in the orifice. I now heard a noise of the
rippling of water, and saw the sea of a deep
shade of blue to about a mile away, where
it then gleamed white and polished, the calm
being still unbrushed there. The ship had
caught a little air of wind; ropes were flung
down overhead, the soft patter of naked, the
sharp beat of shod feet actively running about
sounded through the planks; the silence upon
the water was now broken by the voices of
men singing out as they hauled, and presently
at a pistol-shot distance I saw what might
have been a piece of green timber feathered
with weed slowly slide past.</p>

<p>I looked around me, and my heart was
full of pity when I thought of Captain Sutherland.
I pitied him, I say, and I grieved for
the women and the little children, but the
soldiers and the others did not appeal to me.
I took no interest in the fate of the doctor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
and Captain Barrett, and I never could forget
that one of the soldiers had shot the poor
madman, and that all would have slaughtered
every convict at the word of command with
less compunction than the convicts themselves
had sent them adrift.</p>

<p>The captain&#8217;s cabin was wrecked; he had
slept in a handsome mahogany bunk, and its
mattress was ripped open as though the beasts
who did it hoped to find money or some sort
of booty hidden in the hair. Two little
miniatures had been left to hang upon the
bulkhead; one was the captain, the other a
lady, doubtless his wife, a rather pretty,
grave-looking woman. I thought of how Tom
and I had sat for our miniatures, and wondered
if the captain&#8217;s wife were alive, whether she
would ever see her husband again. Should I
ever have seen Tom again but for my resolution
to hide in the ship that was to transport
him? This reflection made me mad.</p>

<p>Whilst I sat or walked about, lost in inflaming
thoughts, I heard a great noise in the
cuddy and, peeping out, spied some fifteen or
twenty convicts hard at work brushing and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
tidying up the interior. Abram just then
came in with a little company of the ringleaders;
I may tell you that there were perhaps
twelve to fifteen heads in this uprisal,
not counting Tom, whom I never would name
as having had a share in it.</p>

<p>On hearing Abram speak, I held the door
open by about an inch. The prize-fighter and
his crew stood close against my cabin, talking
and looking on at the convicts at work. They
were arranging for their own accommodation.</p>

<p>&#8216;Butler takes the captid&#8217;s cabid, that&#8217;s
fair,&#8217; said Abram. &#8216;His y&#8217;u&#8217;g fre&#8217;d shares it.
That&#8217;s Butler&#8217;s business. Bates a&#8217;d adother
wud&#8217;s provided for yodder. You a&#8217;d be,&#8217; he
continued, addressing one of the convicts,
&#8216;will take the cabid dext to the captid&#8217;s.
Right aft don&#8217;t soot be; the botion there
bakes be ill. The rest of you will fide pledty
of roob. I recobbe&#8217;d that the better order
abogst us tosses or draws for the accommodatiod
dowd-stairs. We dote wadt to be
suffocated by dumbers in this part of the ship;
the old quarters will be thid (thinned) by
those who cub aft; with the hatch oped, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
widsails dowd and the barricade id shivers,
they&#8217;ll be airy edough; ad thed there&#8217;s the
soldiers&#8217; quarters.&#8217;</p>

<p>A few minutes later Tom came in. He
shut the door and took me by the hand and
kissed me; sat down, and made me sit beside
him, still holding my hand, whilst he gazed
at me with the full affection of his dear,
noble heart. He was pale with the heat.
His eyelids dropped with the weariness that
was upon him. He was clad, as throughout
the day, in his convict shirt and trousers.</p>

<p>&#8216;There is a little breeze, and we are under
way again,&#8217; said he. &#8216;I wish it may hold.
There is no telling what ship may fall in with
the boats, and the quicker I can push the
vessel out of these parts the better, though I
must keep the tropic latitudes aboard to get
away in,&#8217; said he, softening his voice. &#8216;We
shall need smooth water and fine weather,
dear one, and God&#8217;s care. It may be done
to-night. It may be done to-morrow night.
All must be in readiness.&#8217;</p>

<p>I told him what I had just overheard.</p>

<p>&#8216;Let them do what they like,&#8217; said he.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
&#8216;This cabin&#8217;s ours, and by that I mean that
it&#8217;s yours. I can rest anywhere whilst you
sleep, and can take a nap here, if you like,
when you are out of it.&#8217;</p>

<p>I was about to speak. He smiled, and
silenced me with his hand.</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t you remember the lectures I used
to give you? Let all things be as I wish.
Will and poor Bates will be safely lodged.
It cannot be for long. A night or two.
Nay a week, if you will. But long it must
not be,&#8217; he added, with a note of passion.
&#8216;Could I keep you in this ship? What have
you already heard and seen? Oh, it is not
fit! It is not fit! Such scum as they are!
Such foul-mouthed hogs! When I think of
what I used to suffer at night in the hulk&mdash;forced
to listen, lying sleepless, though nearly
dead with the awful toil of the day!&#8217;</p>

<p>Our talk then softly and swiftly ran on
many matters which I shall not tease you
with, such as what we should do if we came
off with our lives in the gig; the surest and
yet most convenient places in the world for
Englishmen to hide themselves in; my plans<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
as to the disposal of my house in London;
the drawing of my money secretly, so that
the law should not be able to get at him by
finding out where I was. These things and
the like we talked of whilst we sat hand in
hand, and sometimes he would break off to
kiss me and thank me for my love and loyalty
and to admire me.</p>

<p>I asked him how the gig was to be secretly
provisioned and got ready for lowering.</p>

<p>&#8216;I have arranged for that,&#8217; said he. &#8216;I
told Abram awhile ago on the poop, and
some dozens besides heard me, that it was my
practice at sea to keep my boats provisioned
and watered. I then rattled about our having
but three boats, talked of the big number
of souls aboard, and said that in a day or two,
when things had settled down a bit, I&#8217;d hunt
out the carpenters and handy workmen
amongst the people and put them to making
a number of rafts after a design of my own,
so that in case of foundering no man need
lose his life for the want of something to float
on. This sort of talk pleased them mightily.
Convicts set a high value on their lives. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
bigger the rogue the bigger the price. And
of all the people in this ship Barney Abram is
the man who&#8217;d be the least willing to die, be
his spirit what it will when he enters a ring.
So then and there I told Mr. Bates that the
boats were to be provisioned and watered the
first thing to-morrow morning, and I turned
to Will, who stood by, and significantly
ordered him to take the gig under his own
care and see to her.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That was clever,&#8217; said I, clapping his
hand with mine.</p>

<p>&#8216;The difficulty I foresee,&#8217; he went on, &#8216;is
the helmsman. Yet it is to be managed. I
wish there was no moon this week; but, fair
or foul, I must have you out of this ship of
devils.&#8217;</p>

<p>He then looked about him at the nautical
instruments, the charts and books, peeped
here and there, and took a sorrowful survey
of the plundered berth. He put my convict
mattress and pillow into the bunk and said
that would be my bed by night&mdash;for the night
or two we were to remain on board&mdash;that he
would lock me up out of harm&#8217;s way and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
release me in the morning. I dared not
expostulate; he was my master if he was not
yet my lord; his least command, nay, his
lightest wish, moved me as a powerful impulse.
Where would my dear one himself
sleep? Yet I was afraid to ask.</p>

<p>&#8216;Now,&#8217; said he, &#8216;I want you to keep clear
of the convicts. Get away out of hearing of
them. Lodge yourself here closely; you&#8217;ll
not be missed. I&#8217;ll lock you in, and no one
will dare trouble you. I&#8217;ll tell them you&#8217;re
helping me in the navigation of the ship and
acting as a sort of captain&#8217;s clerk. It&#8217;ll be but
for a day or two. Meanwhile we must eat
and drink. Come forward and see what&#8217;s
doing in the galley.&#8217;</p>

<p>We were leaving the cabin, when he
stopped to exclaim: &#8216;Do you know what a
slop-chest is?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Is there one in the ship?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ve heard Will speak of a slop-chest.&#8217;</p>

<p>He nodded, and we then left the berth.
They had trimmed up the cuddy, but the
starred and splintered mirrors made a ruin of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
it. Abram was gone; a number of convicts
lounged about the interior. Some seemed to
be preparing the cabins; others were seated
with their legs hoisted on to the table, others
sprawled along the cushioned lockers. Most
of them were smoking. A continuous hoarse,
sulky growl of conversation, frequently broken
by a short, deep laugh, rolled through the
cuddy.</p>

<p>Tom called out: &#8216;Do any of you know if
they&#8217;re preparing a meal for the people?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay,&#8217; answered one of the men, &#8216;the cooks
are at work. Some beef&#8217;s been taken out of
the cask, and the officer called Bates has
sarved out tea and sugar&mdash;the reg&#8217;lar muck-mess,
pal.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Where are we to eat?&#8217; exclaimed a heavy-faced,
coarse-voiced man, who sat smoking in
a lounge-chair near the mizzen-mast.</p>

<p>&#8216;The chief&#8217;ll settle that,&#8217; answered Tom.
&#8216;There&#8217;s the whole of the ship for a dinner-table.&#8217;</p>

<p>We walked to the galley. The destruction
of the barricades had vastly improved the look
of the vessel. The decks ran in a clear sweep.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
Some of the men had scrubbed at the stain
where the quarter-deck sentry fell, but the
dye was still red in the plank. The mass of
the convicts aimlessly hung about in groups.
Numbers overhung the rail, staring out to sea
and talking. Others crouched in clusters
under the bulwarks; some had half stripped
themselves. Many were on the poop, where
I caught sight of Mr. Bates walking with
Will.</p>

<p>I called Tom&#8217;s attention to the general air
of listlessness. He answered: &#8216;It&#8217;s partly
heat, partly reaction. They&#8217;ve woke up to
the sense of what&#8217;s happened, and the loneliness
of the sea is upon them, though they
couldn&#8217;t give you a name for their sensations.&#8217;</p>

<p>This brought us to the ship&#8217;s galley. The
convicts had partly demolished their own
kitchen, yet, of the two, it had been more
serviceably furnished for so great a crowd as
the ship contained.</p>

<p>The sun was now hanging low over the
western ocean. I never before beheld it so
vast and so red. Its wake came straight to
the side of the ship from the edge of the sea.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
I saw no cloud, yet a soft, gentle wind blew;
all the water was dark with it, and it tenderly
swelled the ship&#8217;s canvas. All plain sail was
set, saving the main-royal, where the lightning
had left no mast to hoist the yard on. These
observations I made quickly whilst Tom put
his head into the galley-door and talked to
the people within.</p>

<p>The men who had cooked for the convicts
under the doctor were the cooks now. There
were three of them, dressed in clothes stolen
out of the forecastle. Spite of their cropped
crowns and a sort of actor&#8217;s bullet-headed
appearance, that might owe something to
their blue, shorn cheeks and chins, they looked,
in their seamen&#8217;s attire, superior to most of
the fellows who had slept before the mast.
Tom questioned them. A large hook-pot of
steaming tea was then handed to him. He
gave it to me with a glance which I perfectly
understood. They cut off a piece of beef and
put it into a tin dish. With these things and
two or three ship&#8217;s biscuits, which one of the
convicts took from a dresser-drawer two-thirds
full of that sort of bread, we made our way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
aft, I carrying the tea and the beef and walking
after Tom, as though he used me as his servant.</p>

<p>One of a number of convicts at the break
of the poop was Barney Abram. He called
down to know what was that I had. Tom
answered that it was his supper. &#8216;I can&#8217;t
wait for you people,&#8217; said he. &#8216;The mate
must be relieved in a few minutes.&#8217; We then
passed into his cabin.</p>

<p>We wanted sugar; a ridiculous, trifling
matter I should not mention but for this, that,
with Tom&#8217;s leave, I went aft into that small
starboard cabin which Mr. Stiles had made
a larder of, and which before the convicts rose
had always been richly stocked, hams and
sides of bacon hanging from the upper deck,
fine flour and white biscuits in casks, various
sorts of tinned stuffs, with all such necessaries,
not to mention luxuries, which the cabin table
demanded&mdash;I say, when I entered this little
room to seek for a parcel of sugar, I witnessed
a crueller, more abominable scene of waste
than could be invented: Flour-casks split
and the deck covered with dust; broken
bottles of pickles; ham and cheese, as though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
they had been jumped upon. Indeed, I want
memory to describe this horrid picture of
wanton, senseless waste and destruction. Yet
I found what I sought, and took also some
cheese, what I broke from one that lay
already broken upon the deck, filled a tin with
white biscuit out of a gaping cask, and so
returned to Tom.</p>

<p>We made a good meal. Neither of us had
tasted food for many hours. I asked Tom
after he should have gone on deck to send
Will to me, as the lad, being afraid to seek
for food on his own account, might be half
famished for all I knew. Mr. Bates I reckoned
old enough and man enough to look
after himself. I then saw that there was oil
in the bracket-lamp at the bulkhead. Indeed,
the seeing to such things had been a part of
my work under the steward. When Tom had
ended his meal, he got up and said: &#8216;I shall
turn the key upon you and give it to Will,
who&#8217;ll let himself in; but see that he locks
you up when he leaves you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Shan&#8217;t I see you again to-night, Tom?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, yes. I&#8217;ll look in&mdash;say at nine. You<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
can reckon your time by one of the chronometers.
&#8217;Tis Greenwich time, and our time
will be about &mdash;&mdash;,&#8217; and he named it.</p>

<p>He kissed me, and held me by the hands
and looked at me as though his overflowing
heart sought in vain to vent itself; then
cutting the air with his clenched fist as if
maddened by a sudden memory, he stepped
out, turned and withdrew the key.</p>

<p>I waited for Will, but he did not quickly
come. By this time it was nearly dark; some
while earlier, however, I had thoroughly
searched the cabin for means of making fire,
and almost at the minute of giving up found
a tinder-box and flint and matches in a little
white box on a shelf. This apparatus was so
like mine that I might have supposed Mr.
Balls had presented it to the captain.</p>

<p>I lighted the lamp and sat listening to the
noises in the cuddy. There was a constant
tumult of voices and a clatter of metal dishes;
I guessed that a crowd of the convicts were
eating at the table, and, not easily finding fresh
crockery, were employing the prison utensils.
More than an hour had passed since Tom left,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
when the key was turned, and Will entered
holding a pannikin of tea. When the door
opened, the noise in the cuddy came in very
strong and rudely; the wretches seemed to
have gone off their heads again, and were
bawling and singing as though something
stronger than tea had filled their pannikins.
They had managed to trim and light the
cuddy lamps.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s time we were out of it,&#8217; said Will,
pulling off his coat and flinging down his cap
with a shake of the head that drove the sweat
drops in a little shower from his brow. &#8216;I&#8217;d
rather take my chance on a bare plank than
stick another week in this hell&mdash;and a hell it
is, and a worse hell it is likely to become,
though I hate strong words.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Fall to your supper,&#8217; said I, &#8216;and give
me the news as you eat.&#8217;</p>

<p>He went to work and ate heartily. We
had left plenty for him. Whilst he supped,
he said that Abram had made Bates show him
where the rum casks were kept. Bates told
Tom of this, and Will, standing near, heard
Tom ask Abram what the people intended to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
do. &#8216;&#8220;Why,&#8221; says the prize-fighter, &#8220;they&#8217;re
going to brew a few bowls to drink one
another&#8217;s health in. They mean to make a
night of it. Don&#8217;t they deserve a little
pleasure? You&#8217;ll take the head of the table,
Butler, and give us a song.&#8221; &#8220;No,&#8221; says
Tom, &#8220;I&#8217;m in charge of the ship&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
&#8220;There&#8217;s Bates,&#8221; says Abram. &#8220;I&#8217;m in
charge of the ship,&#8221; answered Tom savagely.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t look to me to countenance this sort of
thing. I should have hoped you and the
other leaders valued your safety too highly
to broach a rum-cask for the people.&#8221; A
number of convicts,&#8217; said Will, &#8216;who had
drawn near, told Tom that if he interfered
with their pleasures and liberty, they knew
their remedy. Tom cursed them, and I
thought would have spat at them,&#8217; continued
Will. &#8216;He grasped one of the strongest by
the arm and, pointing to the boats, asked the
man if he could count. The fellow fell back
a step as though Butler had gone mad, and
raised his arm to cover his face. &#8220;Count!&#8221;
roared Tom. &#8220;One, two, three; good to hold
about thirty men, leaving about two hundred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
and twenty to be roasted alive if the ship
takes fire! Thirty to be picked up and
hanged for this job!&#8221; he cried, with a laugh
that had a real note of madness in it: &#8220;and
the rest to be left here to fry or leap overboard,
shrieking like the rats that&#8217;ll show
them the road!&#8221; His manner, instead of
further enraging, seemed to subdue the
beasts. &#8220;There&#8217;ll be no fire,&#8221; said Abram;
&#8220;why do&#8217;t you keep your tepper?&#8221;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What followed?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Butler walked away. Some of the convicts
abused him when his back was turned.
Barney Abram stood up for him. He said
that Butler meant well, and that his anxiety
for the ship&#8217;s safety proved his honesty. He
was bad-tempered and a little mad; he was
mad because he was being transported for
what he had never done. Then, fearing I
might be noticed as a listener, I slunk away,
and Butler gave me the key, and told me to
go to you and get some supper.&#8217;</p>

<p>He stayed until he had had time to make
a good meal. We talked in murmurs, and
nearly all our talk concerned our getting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
away from the ship. He told me that Bates
thought that Tom would have ventured it
this night had the gig been provisioned.
Bates, he said, was wild to get out of the ship.
He feared for his life.</p>

<p>Will went on deck after sitting with me
for half an hour. He locked me in as he had
been bidden, and when he was gone I felt
afraid, for I thought to myself: What shall I
do, locked up below here, if the felons set the
ship on fire?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXVII<br />


<small>SHE DESCRIBES A WILD, DRUNKEN, UPROARIOUS
SCENE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> noise of many voices had been slowly
growing in the cuddy. The swell and the
volume of sound were assurance that the
interior was full. I wondered the people did
not drink and revel on the deck, where there
was plenty of room and fresh air and dewy
coolness. The cuddy, perhaps, was like being
ashore, and put them in mind of their old
haunts. There was no likeness, indeed, to a
tavern in it, yet the convicts might find something
to refresh their memory of the boozing-kens
in the broken mirrors and the low pitch
of the ceiling or upper deck and in the bulkheads,
which would answer to their idea of
walls, particularly should the atmosphere
become dense with tobacco smoke and sickening<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
with the fumes of rum and clamorous as
a houseful of shrieking madmen with the
songs, jokes, laughter, and the many humours
of the stews and kennels.</p>

<p>The <i>Childe Harold</i> was a very stoutly
built ship. The cabin bulkheads were exceedingly
thick and substantial. I could not
hear individual voices plainly; the combined
growl of the men&#8217;s speech, often rising into a
sort of roar like to the noise of a breaker
sweeping back from a beach after it has burst
into froth, overwhelmed the particular notes
and accents which swelled it. Sometimes I
thought I could hear Barney Abram shouting,
then there&#8217;d happen a sinking in the tumult
when I&#8217;d catch a loud, coarse laugh, solitary
and startling, or the voice of a man beginning
a song that was quickly drowned by the
freshening of the hubbub.</p>

<p>There was a constant scraping and squeezing
past my cabin bulkhead, as though of
people coming and going or thrusting to
make room, with a jarring grumble of talk
but indistinct to me. This sort of thing may
have gone on for about half an hour. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
looked at the chronometer, and calculated
that it was about half-past eight. I longed
for nine o&#8217;clock, when Tom had promised to
come. The people were fast growing noisier.
Frequent scuffles occurred just outside my
door. The cuddy was densely packed, and
the scuffling signified the struggle of some of
the fellows to draw close to the table where
the drink was.</p>

<p>It was short of nine by a quarter of an
hour when the key was turned and Tom came
in. This cabin-door was close to the cuddy
quarter-deck entrance; yet the interior was
so full that when Tom entered and came in
with a sort of run, as though he had helped
himself with his elbows, I saw the crowd,
close-packed, pressed hard against Bates&#8217;s
cabin opposite, as they were against mine.
&#8216;Hold my arm,&#8217; said Tom. I seized him, and
he took me through the door and shoved to
right and left to make a passage through, the
cuddy entrance, that stood but five or six feet
away. He then returned to lock the door.</p>

<p>I was now able to see and hear. The
cuddy, as I had suspected, was packed full.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
The sailors had joined the convicts, so that
there were over two hundred and forty people
in that roasting interior. The atmosphere
was dark with tobacco smoke, through which
the large cabin-lamps loomed like the red
moon in a mist. I coughed violently even
on the quarter-deck whilst I looked through
the open door, waiting for Tom to come out.
By standing on the coamings of the booby-hatch,
I got a view over the heads of the
crowd and saw the whole picture.</p>

<p>Abram sat at the head of the table in shirt
and trousers only; his black, pitted, ugly
face shone with sweat; they had put one
chair on top of another for him, and he sat
with his legs wide apart and his feet on the
table; between his knees was a pail, out of
which he was ladling drink into pannikins
which endlessly travelled his way, or were
extended at arm&#8217;s length to him. He seemed
half drunk, and occasionally withdrew the
ladle full of the liquor to flourish it over his
head, whilst he uttered a roar like a beast
expressing joy and having no note but a roar;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
at such times he swayed on his perch as
though he must topple over.</p>

<p>As yet not many of the felons were intoxicated,
but anyone could see how it must be
with them presently. The younger amongst
the people made the most noise. Again there
was the aimless shouting of the morning, the
roaring chaff, the yells one to another from
distant points, the frequent breaking into
songs, with local choruses, swaggeringly
chanted by those near the singer. The heat
was frightful; I was amazed that the wretches
could draw breath. At this foremost end of
the table, high-perched like the ruffian Abram,
was the hare-lipped convict; he, too, had a
big pail of liquor betwixt his legs, the contents
of which he served out with a pannikin.
Nearly every man had a pipe, and again and
again one or another of the convicts rose to
get a light at the lamps. They stood on their
chairs with a foot on the table and dodged
drunkenly at the flame, with an open end of
rope-yarn or a piece of wood, and whilst it
burnt freely they lighted their pipes, blowing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
out dense clouds, and then they&#8217;d pass the
burning brands to men shouting for them.</p>

<p>This was shocking to see. Nothing in the
behaviour of the malefactors was so fearfully
menacing. All that I here describe I witnessed
in the few moments whilst I waited for
Tom to lock the door. He forced his way
out, took me by the arm, and in silence we
mounted the poop-ladder. Oh, the sweetness
of the air up there and the peace and beauty
of that gentle tropic night! The moon was
up, the dark sky was crowded with stars to
the horizon, the ship was sailing noiselessly
before the wind. Aloft, where the sails
swelled stirless as carvings of stone, glowing
in the beams of the moon that shone athwart
them, all was silent. Forward, not a figure
stirred. Aft, Mr. Bates walked on one side
of the deck, and by the clear, white light in
the air I distinguished Will at the wheel.
Tom spoke no word till we were on the poop.
He then said: &#8216;I believe we shall be able to
get away to-night.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The sooner the better, Tom.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;If they don&#8217;t set fire to the ship,&#8217; said he,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
&#8216;we may be able to get away easily, and in a
quarter-boat. I chose the gig because she
hangs where she may be lowered without
much risk of observation; but the people
down there mean to drink themselves dead-drunk.
If that happens, we&#8217;ll take a quarter-boat.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Is that Will at the wheel?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Aye. The dog whose trick was up
refused to stand any longer when he understood
there was grog going in the cabin. No
other man would come aft to relieve him.
So much the better. It all works for us.&#8217;</p>

<p>We joined Mr. Bates and went to the
helm and stood there. They were now
making a horrible roaring noise in the cuddy.
It sounded like a great, drunken cheering of
a &#8216;sentiment,&#8217; or speech.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ve been watching them light their
pipes,&#8217; said Mr. Bates. &#8216;We must stand by,
Butler.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Bates, it&#8217;s to be done!&#8217; exclaimed Tom,
looking round the sea. &#8216;What shall we
want? Nothing that may not be got and
stowed in twenty minutes. Johnstone, jump<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
forward and try one of the scuttle-butts. If
there&#8217;s water, fill a couple of boat&#8217;s beakers.&#8217;</p>

<p>He took the wheel from the lad, who fled
off the poop like the shadow of a cloud in a
gale.</p>

<p>&#8216;Which is the better quarter-boat. Bates?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The aftermost.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;See if it&#8217;s all right with her.&#8217;</p>

<p>The mate sprang upon a hencoop and got
into the boat, where his figure was lost. He
came out after a few minutes and reported
everything in its place. Will returned; he
said that the starboard scuttle-butt was half full,
took the beaker out of the boat and
went forward. When this was filled he took
the beaker from the other boat, filled and
stowed it in the boat we meant to use.</p>

<p>Just then a hush fell upon the people
below. It startled one, so suddenly did it
come on top of the noise. The skylights
lay wide open; I stepped to one and looked
down. Some of the convicts already lay with
their heads buried in their arms upon the
table, motionless in deep, drunken sleep.
Others who were within the compass of my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
gaze leaned back, staring in the stupefaction
of drink with fixed eyes. A few lay like
dead men upon the deck. But the great
mass were still wide awake, full of the fever
of drink and the life of their own hideous
spirits; as many as I could see were all looking
aft where Abram sat, and I had not been
watching a minute when Abram, whose deep
bass voice, considerably thickened and deepened
yet by the drams he had drained, roared
out the following song (I caught some of the
words and long afterward met with the
verses):</p>

<p>The prize-fighter sang it thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">As clever Tob Pitch, while the rabble was bawli&#8217;g,</div>
<div class="verse">Rode stately through &#8217;Olbord to die id his calli&#8217;g,</div>
<div class="verse">He stopped at the George for a bottle of sack,</div>
<div class="verse">A&#8217;d probised to pay for it whed he cabe back.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Here broke in a roar of laughter.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">His waistcoat a&#8217;d stockids a&#8217;d breeches were white,</div>
<div class="verse">His cap had a dew cherry ribbon to tie&#8217;t.</div>
<div class="verse">The baids to the doors a&#8217;d the balcodies rad,</div>
<div class="verse">A&#8217;d said: &#8216;Lack-a-day, he&#8217;s a proper yu&#8217;g bad.&#8217;</div>
</div></div>

<p>The singer was again interrupted by another
great shout of laughter. It may have
been his drunken grimaces and thick pronunciation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
that amused the convicts; there
seemed not much to laugh at in the words of
his song.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">But as at the windows the ladies he spied,</div>
<div class="verse">Like a beau id the box he bowed low od each side!</div>
<div class="verse">A&#8217;d whed the last speech the loud &#8217;awkers did cry,</div>

<div class="verse">The ha&#8217;gbad for pardod fell dowd od his dee;</div>
<div class="verse">Tob gave hib a kick id the guts for his fee&mdash;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Here broke in another shout that lasted
some moments. The convicts beat upon the
table with their pannikins; several flaming
matches were passed along and pipes sucked
hard. The atmosphere rose through that
open skylight hot as a blast from a furnace
and dark with tobacco clouds. The prize-fighter,
in a thicker and deeper voice, proceeded:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Tob said: &#8216;I bust speak to the people a little;</div>
<div class="verse">But I&#8217;ll see you all cussed here before I will whittle.</div>

<div class="verse">Thed follow the practice of clever Tom Pitch,</div>
<div class="verse">Who hung like a &#8217;ero ad dever would flitch!</div>
</div></div>

<p>On finishing this song, the prize-fighter
bellowed in a loud voice of thunder: &#8216;Chorus,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>

drunken mob, in every variety of note, till the
chorus was no more than an ear-splitting, discordant
howling, repeated</p>

<p>The convicts vastly enjoyed their own
singing. They shrieked, cheered, whistled,
hammered and roared, and roared again with
laughter and applause. Whilst I looked I
saw a man fall dead-drunk from his chair
right under the skylight and lie like a log on
the deck. (This was the lean, grey man who
had talked of the devils that swam in a rum-cask.)
I thought of that day when Mr.
Barney Abram sat with other prisoners under
the skylight and lifted up his voice in a song of
devotion, and the doctor&#8217;s stern face of approval
came before me.</p>

<p>Some men on the main-deck laughed
loudly and talked uproariously. They were
convicts going to the galley for hot water to
mix fresh pails of rum with. The moonshine
lay white on the planks, and you could see
the buckets swaying in the fellows&#8217; hands as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
they lurched, laughing and talking, toward
the galley, about whose open door hovered
the sheen of a lamp burning within.</p>

<p>&#8216;I hope they&#8217;ll not end at this,&#8217; said Tom,
standing at my side and speaking to Mr. Bates.
&#8216;If they don&#8217;t get more drunk, they&#8217;ll fall to
fighting, and bethink them of the soldiers&#8217;
weapons under the poop, and turn the cabin
into a shambles.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The drink takes effect quickly,&#8217; said Mr.
Bates.</p>

<p>&#8216;Many of them haven&#8217;t tasted a drop for
years!&#8217; exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>The people below fell silent again; a loud,
clear voice, that did not seem in liquor, began
to sing. I guessed from the direction in which
the convicts&#8217; heads were turned that the
singer was the hare-lipped man. We came
away from the skylight and stood near the
wheel, which Will held.</p>

<p>&#8216;This wind is taking off,&#8217; said Mr. Bates.</p>

<p>Tom looked aloft and then round the sea.
He started, peered a little eagerly and,
pointing, exclaimed: &#8216;Is that a vessel yonder
in the flow of the moonlight?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>Will, who had keen eyes, looked and
said: &#8216;Yes, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>The mate fetched the glass from the companion-way
and gave it to Tom, who said:
&#8216;It&#8217;s a little brig, I think.&#8217;</p>

<p>The mate pointed the telescope, and when
he was done with it I asked leave to look.
He steadied the glass, and I quite clearly saw
the vessel. She lay exactly under the moon
in the full stream of the silver light, where
the first of it smote the dark edge and flowed
across the ocean.</p>

<p>&#8216;How is she heading?&#8217; said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8216;She seems to be standing south,&#8217; answered
the mate.</p>

<p>&#8216;Would she not receive us?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;We can&#8217;t board anything in these clothes,&#8217;
exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>&#8216;She don&#8217;t seem to be travelling,&#8217; exclaimed
the mate. &#8216;She hangs steady under
the moon. Perhaps the calm&#8217;s about her.
The heat&#8217;s drying up the breeze.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Suppose she should have the doctor,
soldiers, and the rest of them on board,&#8217; said
Will.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>&#8216;Butler,&#8217; exclaimed Mr. Bates with energy,
&#8216;I swear you have nothing to fear. You
are innocent; you have saved life; you have
witnesses&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;</p>

<p>Tom stamped on the deck and turned his
back with a gesture that was like saying he
had settled that question in previous talks
with the mate.</p>

<p>They were again howling out a chorus in
the cuddy; the tobacco smoke rose like steam
into the moonshine through both open skylights;
shouts for drink and for pipe-lights
were incessant. Tom, hearing a sound of
scuffling coming from the main-deck, went to
the rail and stood looking. He returned and
said: &#8216;A dozen of them have staggered out
for air, I suppose; the freshness has proved
too strong, and every man dropped as though
knocked on the head. There they lie, dead-drunk
on the decks.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That vessel sits without life,&#8217; said the
mate, looking at the sea under the moon.
&#8216;I&#8217;ve been watching her. She&#8217;s either hove
to or there&#8217;s something wrong.&#8217;</p>

<p>Our own languid motion had drawn the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
little craft out of the brilliant reflection. She
now hung on the margin of it, scarce distinguishable
but for the faint light her sails
made. I suppose she was about five miles
distant; certainly she had not seemed to
move to the extent of her own length since
we caught sight of her.</p>

<p>Our canvas was now hollowing in. The
white cloths came to the mast softly and
shook the dew upon them on the deck. The
sea was grown glassy under the moon, and
round about were ice-like windings of tremorless
water. The breeze was falling fast, and
the heat that came in a sort of fold like a
succession of swells out of the gathering calm
was heightened to every sense by a vast play
of shooting stars over our mast-heads. Tom
stepped to the skylight to observe the time;
it was something after ten.</p>

<p>The uproar was at its height again below.
A hundred voices seemed to be singing a
hundred different songs at once. In the
midst of this, half a dozen figures came into
the companion-way. They all talked as they
ploughed up the steps, shoving one another in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
their drunken scramble to keep steady. The
first of them fell over the coaming and lay
laughing and cursing; the next tripped over
him, but recovered himself, with a mouthful
of oaths, and with a stroke of his foot rolled
the prostrate man aside. The fellow laughed
like one choking, then lay motionless, and
before the others had come up he was
snoring.</p>

<p>One of these men was Barney Abram. He
stood in the companion-way, holding on and
looking about him with his figure stooped.</p>

<p>&#8216;Here&#8217;s Butler!&#8217; exclaimed a man, talking
brokenly and hiccoughing. &#8216;Come below,
my rooster. Ain&#8217;t ye longer one of us, old
drummer? Come and drink. Don&#8217;t make it
all greediness downstairs. Take your whack,
my lobscouser, and let&#8217;s hear you sing.&#8217;</p>

<p>He extended his hand. Tom put it aside,
but without temper.</p>

<p>&#8216;I have drunk enough. I can&#8217;t stand the
heat down there, and I can&#8217;t be there and
here too, and the ship wants watching.
Abram, you sing a good song.&#8217;</p>

<p>The prize-fighter came out of the companion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
and stood in front of Tom, slightly
swaying his body.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s bit of a cub-dowd!&#8217; he exclaimed.
&#8216;My wife wouldn&#8217;t like to hear of it. I cad
fadcy her,&#8217; he said, directing his moist eyes at
the moon, &#8216;saying, &#8220;Bardey, &#8217;ow could yer
as a public bad?&#8221; By adswer would be exceedingly
sipple: &#8220;Biriab, it was id bid-ocead,
ad there&#8217;s dot a codger abugst the whole
blazi&#8217;g boili&#8217;g of the fagots whose opidiod of be
as a public bad I value at that!&#8221;&#8217; He snapped
his immense muscular fingers with the report
of the explosion of a cap of a musket-nipple.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;d rather have a shant o&#8217; gatter (pot of
beer) to blow an inch of tripe of nosey-nick-nacker
with than a caskful of that devil&#8217;s fire
on tap below,&#8217; exclaimed one of the men.
&#8216;It&#8217;s gammy for the head&mdash;gammy&mdash;gammy.&#8217;
He pulled off his cap and sent it with a kick
flying overboard, and, putting his hands to his
brow, groaned, swinging his head from side to
side. He then blindly reeled over to a hencoop,
fell against it, kneeling, and stretched
his length.</p>

<p>A third fellow, who had stood looking at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
the moon for some minutes in silence, with a
drunken, imbecile grin, began to cry. He
snuffled and whimpered and exclaimed in
broken, tipsy tones, &#8216;What &#8217;ud my poor
mother think? Ho, yes, she brought me up
in the straight ways, and this is what it&#8217;s
come to. Never was there a better scholard
nor me nor vun more promising till I fell in
with a sneaksman. It was all along of a
footman&mdash;&mdash;&#8217; Here he blubbered and could
not go on.</p>

<p>&#8216;&#8217;Ark at Sipsod shedding tears!&#8217; exclaimed
Abram. &#8216;What&#8217;s &#8217;e got to cry about? Let
the people he robbed cry. Bates, cub-dowd
a&#8217;d &#8217;ave a drink.&#8217;</p>

<p>The convict named Simpson shuffled to the
companion-hatch, with some trouble got his leg
over the coaming, and then fell down the steps.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ve had all that I can stand up under,
Mr. Abram,&#8217; answered Bates, &#8216;thanking you
kindly.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I wish you&#8217;d sing another song, Mr.
Abram; I never heard so powerful and manly
a voice,&#8217; said I, hoping by this to get him below,
where a few more drams would finish him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>&#8216;I studied busic udder the great Jo&#8217;d
Brahub,&#8217; he answered, wagging his head with
his indescribable leering smirk, that was
deepened and made more repulsive, if possible,
by the drink he had swallowed; the moon
shone very clear, and expressions on the face
were easily read. &#8216;If I car&#8217;t si&#8217;g, who cad?
By lay was Hi-taliad opera, but the ri&#8217;g answered
by purpose better.&#8217;</p>

<p>This he spoke in the most gentlemanly
manner his tipsiness would suffer. Mr. Bates
saw my meaning.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll go with you below, sir, and drink
your health, and hope to have the pleasure of
hearing you sing another song.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Cub along,&#8217; said the prize-fighter, and
both men went down the steps.</p>

<p>The din in the cuddy was still vile and
distracting; but it wanted its former volume.
I looked through the skylight and found as
much of the table as I could see thick with
the stupefied brutes, who, seated, lay upon it
from their waists in every sort of drunken
posture, most of which not a man amongst
them could have put himself into had he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
been sober. A score and more lay without
life or motion on the cabin deck, but numbers
were awake, and pannikins of grog were being
handed along. The haze of the tobacco
smoke hung dark as a river-fog.</p>

<p>I walked to the break of the poop and
counted some twenty or twenty-five dark
figures lying helplessly insensible in various
parts of the main- and quarter-deck; men
reeled out of the cuddy, as I looked, fell
down, with their hands outstretched, and
never moved. It was as Tom said: the
wretches had not tasted liquor for months,
and many of them for years, and now they
had been swallowing fiery ship&#8217;s rum, I know
not how many degrees above proof.</p>

<p>(I once, in Mr. Stiles&#8217;s time, put my
tongue to a &#8216;neat&#8217; dram or &#8216;tot,&#8217; as it is
called, and was burned as though by a flame.)</p>

<p>Numbers, I doubted not, had swallowed
the burning poison undiluted. The spectacle
of the quarter-deck, above all the sight of the
figures lurching out and then dropping as
though shot, was sickening and frightful.</p>

<p>I went back to Tom. As I passed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
skylight, Abram began to sing; but his voice
was full of drink, very hideously thick and
his delivery tuneless. I was sure, after pausing
an instant to listen, that he would soon be
amongst those who were laid low.</p>

<p>&#8216;I shall make for that brig,&#8217; said Tom,
&#8216;when we get away.&#8217;</p>

<p>I strained my sight, and then barely distinguished
the vessel in the obscurity some
distance from the edge of the flood of moonshine.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s a dead calm,&#8217; I said.</p>

<p>&#8216;It matters not,&#8217; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;Shouldn&#8217;t we first contrive to roll those
fellows off the poop?&#8217; said Will at the wheel,
meaning the figures upon the deck.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;ll take them all night to sleep off
what they&#8217;ve got,&#8217; answered Tom. &#8216;I hope
Bates won&#8217;t allow them to make him drunk.
He&#8217;s afraid of Abram.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Where are the rest who came up with
the prize-fighter?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Gone below for more drink.&#8217;</p>

<p>We stood conversing in whispers. Abram&#8217;s
singing had subdued, but only subdued, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
noise in the cabin, yet we could hear one
another when we whispered. After twenty
minutes, Mr. Bates came up. I regarded him
anxiously. His face shone in the moonshine
as though he had just lifted his head out of a
bucket of oil.</p>

<p>&#8216;The heat below! Oh, the heat below!
It&#8217;s wonderful they&#8217;re not all dead men!&#8217; he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>He told us that he had managed to empty
his pannikin on the deck before putting it to
his lips. They had handed him pure rum to
drink. Had he swallowed the dose he must
have fallen down insensible. The people
close to him were too drunk to observe him.
He dexterously, whilst seeming to watch
Abram, as though to catch his eye to drink
his health, poured out the contents of the
pannikin, and did not know that the rum had
splashed over a man&#8217;s face until he looked
down. The man, lying like one dead upon
the deck, received the discharge without a
stir. It seems, however, that Mr. Bates need
not have put himself to any trouble to feign
drinking. Abram got on to the double chair<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
and began to sing, without taking any notice
of the mate. In the midst of his song he
stopped to lift a pannikin to his lips, which
he emptied, and was then proceeding, when
the upper chair gave way and he fell. After
the prize-fighter had lain a few moments
groaning in sickness, he clawed his way to
one of the cabins, and Bates came on deck.</p>

<p>Soon after eleven o&#8217;clock, a tipsy figure,
approaching Tom, stood lurching and backing
and filling. The man was a sailor. He
asked, with a drunken, broken laugh, if he
should take the wheel.</p>

<p>&#8216;Get away to your hammock!&#8217; shouted
Tom. &#8216;We&#8217;ll see to the ship. Off you go,
and tell the rest of you to turn in till you&#8217;ve
slept the drink off.&#8217;</p>

<p>The man went reeling forward, and in a
maudlin voice broke into a song as he worked
his way off the poop.</p>

<p>But nothing could be done till the silence
of drunken sleep was upon the ship. I never
could have dreamed that of two hundred and
twenty odd convicts, all would have overpowered
themselves with liquor. There were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
grey-haired men and men of education, people
who had filled good positions ashore. One, as
I have said, was a surgeon, another had been
an officer in the army. There were several
clerks and young fellows who had been apprenticed
to respectable callings. One had
been a harbour missionary. No need to
lengthen the dismal catalogue. A few, at
least, I had thought would have held aloof
from the hellish revelries of the cuddy, have
come on deck and breathed the fresh night-air
and watched the beautiful moonlight after
a moderate sup or two from Abram&#8217;s and
the hare-lipped man&#8217;s buckets. Such persons
I had looked for, and wondered how we
should be able to get away without their hearing
or observing us. But, it seems that there
was not a convict in the whole living mass of
wretches, counting two hundred and thirty
souls, less Tom and the fellows that had lost
their lives in the morning, who had not entered
heart and soul into this hideous merry-making.</p>

<p>Tom found out that by going down the
companion-steps and taking a view of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
interior. The hour was then about a quarter
to twelve. About half a score of the felons
were still awake, but drinking always. They
were too drunk to make much noise, and
happily too overtaken in liquor to be able to
light their pipes. The heat was killing, Tom
said. He should not be surprised if several of
the people were found dead.</p>

<p>&#8216;Bates,&#8217; said he, &#8216;get you now down with
Will and overhaul the slop-chest and bring up
what you know is needful. They&#8217;ll take no
notice of you in the cuddy. They&#8217;re nearly
blind drunk; they&#8217;re at the aftermost end
where Abram was, and the atmosphere&#8217;s black
with tobacco, and the cabin lights burn pale.
Johnstone, I don&#8217;t want Marian to leave my
side. Here&#8217;s the key of my cabin-door. Bring
up the clothes.&#8217;</p>

<p>Bates and my cousin went away. Tom
now said he would go the round of the ship.</p>

<p>&#8216;We must see all the lights out before we
leave her,&#8217; said he. &#8216;Think of a fire with the
people in the state they&#8217;re in!&#8217;</p>

<p>He walked to the lifeless figures on the
poop and moved them with his foot; they lay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
as senseless as the plank they rested on. He
then passed down the steps and I lost sight of
him. I guessed that the convicts had been
too drunk to climb the poop-ladder, or to
attempt the poop by the companion-steps;
that was why there was none on this deck
save those two or three of Barney Abram&#8217;s
party who had stumbled, and, being down,
had instantly slept.</p>

<p>I looked into that part of the night where
the brig lay and dimly discerned her. I forget
where the moon at this hour stood, and
with what bulk she had risen. Silence was
gathering on the convict ship. Occasionally
the hoarse, tipsy call of a man in the cuddy
vexed the ear, but those noises were rare, and
I was pretty sure that another quarter of an
hour would do the wretches&#8217; business and
sink them in the universal stupor. I wondered
if the moon had ever before shone down upon
a more shocking picture of human bestiality.
And yet how exquisitely was the ship painted
by the night beam in the midst of that vast
ocean hush! The sails hung like sheets of
cloth of silver; every shroud had a glint that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
resembled a thread of silver wire; stars of
white fire sparkled in the brass of the binnacle
hood and in the glass of the skylights, and the
rail seemed encrusted with diamonds and
precious gems. The whole ship hung pale
upon the sea, with never a pulse to rock her;
her spires rose phantasmally to the stars, but
her beauty was ghostly and the horror of sin
was in it.</p>

<small>SHE ESCAPES FROM THE CONVICT SHIP WITH
HER SWEETHEART AND OTHERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Bates</span> and Will arrived, each bearing
a burden of clothes from the slop-chest. I
advised the mate to go behind the mizzen-mast
and shift his convict clothes at once.
He seemed unnerved and wanting in spirit, as
though broken down by the scenes and sights
of the day and night, and obeyed me as if I
had been Tom or his captain. Will was
dressed as throughout; it had strangely happened
that no convict had forced him to exchange
clothes. He went to Tom&#8217;s cabin
and brought up my bundle and monkey-jacket;
the latter I slipped on, throwing Tom&#8217;s
convict coat overboard with passion and
loathing. Will told me that only two or three
men were now awake in the cuddy; one had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
fallen under the table just as he had passed
up through the steerage hatch.</p>

<p>I quitted the wheel to look through the
skylight, but the waking men sat too far aft to
be seen; I heard the murmur of their fuddled
voices, and was sure by the tones that the
noise must cease in a few minutes. The
picture remained as I have described it; the
convicts lay over the table and in twenty
various postures. Under the table, and betwixt
the table and the bulkhead, they were heaped
up as though slaughtered. A dreadful smell
rose through the open skylight. Fragments
of broken pipes, shreds of wearing apparel,
capsized pannikins and hook-pots, overset
pails of rum covered the deck and table. I
was sure that Tom was right in thinking that
when those senseless, beastlike shapes came to
be looked at in the morning, many would be
found corpses. Mr. Bates, having changed
his clothes, stood beside me dressed in a suit
of black cloth and a cloth cap. He said:
&#8216;Shall Johnstone and I start on provisioning
the boat? I shouldn&#8217;t like to act without
instructions from Butler.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>&#8216;No time should be lost,&#8217; I answered; &#8216;but
where will you find provisions, Mr. Bates?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;ll look around,&#8217; he said. &#8216;I hope it
mayn&#8217;t come to our having to break out fresh
stores.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We shall want nothing if the brig receives
us,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;True; but we must go away well provisioned
nevertheless.&#8217;</p>

<p>Just then Tom came along the poop. He
sprang on to the hencoop and placed some
parcels in the boat, joined us and said: &#8216;I&#8217;ve
secured the chronometer, a sextant, some
charts and a tinder-box. All&#8217;s quiet now in
the cuddy. What a terrible scene! I was
obliged to tread upon the bodies of men to
look into the cabins. Many lie capsized upon
their backs, their legs upon the seats. The
light&#8217;s bad, yet I made out Abram on the
deck of a berth. There&#8217;s a whole hundred
and thirty people below in that cuddy!
Would any man credit the story of such a
wholesale drugging and damning by drink?
They lie thick under the break there, and the
main-deck&#8217;s strewn with them. The forecastle&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
empty. But all&#8217;s not quiet yet in the
ship,&#8217; said he, speaking very quickly and softly.
&#8216;A fellow under the bulwarks yonder sat up and
called me by name. I took no notice. Two or
three men just now staggered off the gratings
on the main-hatch to seek more comfortable
resting-places. We must wait awhile.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Shall Johnstone and I get the boat provisioned?&#8217;
said Mr. Bates.</p>

<p>&#8216;Aye, do your best, Bates, and promptly.
Provision us as though we were to be a
fortnight afloat.&#8217;</p>

<p>He strained his eyes in the direction of the
brig. My cousin and the other left the poop.</p>

<p>The time slipped by. I stepped to the
skylight and found the hour ten minutes to
one. Bates and Will came and went and
came again, and at every trip they brought a
load. I believe they found ship&#8217;s bread in the
forecastle and some raw hams and drum-big
tins of boiled meat in the galley. I asked no
questions, however. The time of our departure
was drawing near and I was frightened and
nervous. I never could tell at what moment
some of the convicts might get the better of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
their stupor and come upon the poop for the
whiteness of the planks and for the airiness of
the lodging it offered. I could not persuade
myself that so vast a number of persons should
be as drugged and lifeless as though a strong
dose of laudanum had gone to every dram.
Yet, whether I credited it or not, I had but to
use my eyes to witness the truth. I had but to
descend the cabin steps, I had but to walk
around the quarter- and main-decks of that
now silent shadowy convict ship, to know
there was scarce a man but was stone-senseless
with rum. Sometimes a beastlike cry broke
from below, sometimes a drunken shout
sounded forward. These noises were startling,
but we speedily found they signified nothing.</p>

<p>Tom went to the head of the starboard
poop-ladder and looked and listened. He returned,
descended the companion-steps, and,
after looking and listening, put out all the
lights. It was then about a quarter past two.
The moon had made a deal of westing, and
was red and shone no longer very brightly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Johnstone,&#8217; said my sweetheart, in a
whisper, &#8216;have you a knife?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>&#8216;Yes, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Cut the gig&#8217;s and yonder boat&#8217;s falls
short off just under where they are belayed.
Quick, my lad! Bates, it must be done.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;God help them!&#8217; said the mate. &#8216;But
there are sailors who&#8217;ll show them what to do
should it come to a sudden call.&#8217;</p>

<p>Will came from his job. The gripes of
our boat were then noiselessly cast adrift.</p>

<p>&#8216;Jump in, Marian! Jump in, Johnstone!&#8217;
said Tom.</p>

<p>Will and I sprang into the boat and sat
low, and in a moment or two the dark side
of the ship swarmed upward as we descended.
The boat splashed when she floated. Some
fellow at that instant halloed long and dismally.
The melancholy, dreadful cry was
re-echoed by the sails, and the voice was as
that of a strong man mortally wounded and
yielding up his ghost in a death shout.</p>

<p>&#8216;Some beast shrieking in a dream,&#8217; said
Will.</p>

<p>As he spoke, the figures of Tom and the
mate leaned to the falls, and they came down
the tackles into the boat, hand over hand.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
The blocks were quickly unhooked, and Mr.
Bates, with the boat-hook in his hand, poled
us under the huge, dark counter of the
<i>Childe Harold</i>. Three oars were noiselessly
thrown over and paddled us clear of the ship.</p>

<p>Scarcely were we gone ten lengths when
again we heard that strange, wild, melancholy,
halloing cry. Tom said, &#8216;Is not that
a man there on the fo&#8217;c&#8217;s&#8217;le?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; said Will; &#8216;he is reeling and
waving. He&#8217;ll be overboard if he doesn&#8217;t
mind his eye.&#8217;</p>

<p>The fellow let fly a sudden yell.</p>

<p>&#8216;Curse him!&#8217; cried Tom. &#8216;He sees us.
Give way now.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There he goes!&#8217; cried Mr. Bates.</p>

<p>A cry like the scream of a gull came
across the silent sea, and we heard the plunge
and splash of the wretch. Mr. Bates and
Will tilted their oars as though to put back.</p>

<p>&#8216;Pull!&#8217; cried Tom fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8216;Won&#8217;t you return to pick him up?&#8217; said
the mate.</p>

<p>&#8216;Pull!&#8217; hissed Tom. &#8216;Return to that
ship? Pull! Break your backs! A suicide<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
in delirium. Let them all leap! There&#8217;s the
peace of God over the side; there&#8217;s the devil&#8217;s
own hell within board. Pull!&#8217;</p>

<p>He strained at his own oar with fury; the
others plied with all their might. The boat
buzzed over the smooth surface, the smudge
of the craft for which we were making was
dead-on-end over the bow. The moon hung
low, large, and red; the situation of our boat
put the convict ship right over against the
satellite, and the vessel was painted upon the
red surface of the orb. Never did the ocean
offer a more impressive night-piece. An awful
horror went into the ship out of the fancy
of the man drowning alongside. Her sails
showed as though cut out of black paper
against the moon; her rigging ran in fine
black lines; the ship looked to be afloat in
vapour, so smoky was the obscurity which
moved over the face of that black, greasy calm
in folds like smoke.</p>

<p>There was no more halloing; so still was
the breast on which the vessel lay that never
a sound of the flap of canvas, the jar of a
wheel chain, the clank of a topsail-sheet came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
from her. Slowly she receded to the impulse
of our oars; then sliding out of the sphere of
the moon, she glimmered dimly and hovered
like a pale cloud rising off the edge of the
sea.</p>

<p>Tom and the others rowed steadily; they
had slackened their rage, and the boat foamed
along to the steady sweep of the blades. They
talked as they pulled.</p>

<p>&#8216;Bates, I wouldn&#8217;t have put back,&#8217; said
Tom, &#8216;if fifty of them had sprung overboard.
It was too late. Once away from such a ship
as that, it must be away for ever with us.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re in the right. It was just the
impulse to save life, Butler.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I smell wind,&#8217; said Will.</p>

<p>The mate turned his head and exclaimed:
&#8216;Yes, there&#8217;s a dark line of wind to the
south&#8217;ard, Johnstone.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What will happen to the convict ship if
a strong wind should catch her as she lies,
without a living creature on the look-out or
at the wheel?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Let the masts be ripped out of her,&#8217;
exclaimed Tom. &#8216;She&#8217;ll be fallen in with.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
Lie with dogs and rise with fleas! The mere
seeing her people, the mere listening to them
makes a man feel a beast, because he&#8217;s shaped
like them. Oh, Bates, Bates, think of months
of living with them! Where&#8217;s the brig?&#8217;</p>

<p>She was now showing in a big dark blotch
at the distance of about two miles. Already
the water was rippling to a light breeze, but
no weight was in it to cause anxiety, by
which I mean no vessel could be propelled by
the draught as fast as we could row.</p>

<p>Tom said: &#8216;Bates, you will leave it to me
to explain. You and Miss Johnstone and her
cousin will hear me spin my yarn. There&#8217;ll
be little to say. Only let this be understood:
You&#8217;re the mate and I&#8217;m the second mate.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you know, Tom,&#8217; said I, &#8216;that you
are still wearing the convict trousers and
shirt?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;By Heaven, I had forgotten!&#8217; he cried,
jumping up. &#8216;Marian, take my seat and hold
this oar.&#8217;</p>

<p>He went into the bows. Often had I
pulled an oar upon the Thames and loved the
diversion. I rowed now heartily with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
others, and little was lost by Tom leaving his
seat. He shifted with a sailor&#8217;s smartness in
a few minutes, and hove his abominable convict
apparel overboard. His dress was composed
of such slops as the mate was attired in,
black cloth and a cloth cap. He took the
oar from me, and I seated myself again in the
stern-sheets.</p>

<p>&#8216;That brig is hove to,&#8217; said I. &#8216;Look at
her. She seems to be waiting for us.&#8217;</p>

<p>I said this when she was half a mile off.
She was then plain in sight; a small brig
under topsails and maintopgallant-sail; the
squares of those sails were outlined against
the stars. She showed no light and hung
visionary and silent in the voidlike gloom,
the sea and the night being blent into a sort
of flowing darkness by the blowing of the
wind. We drew close, and Tom, throwing in
his oar, stood up and hailed her. He got no
answer. He hailed her four or five times,
but all remained deathlike on board.</p>

<p>&#8216;The look-out sleeps well,&#8217; said Mr. Bates.</p>

<p>&#8216;She is derelict,&#8217; said Tom. &#8216;I&#8217;ve been
thinking so ever since soon after I first saw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
her. Shove alongside; get aboard and trim if
there&#8217;s no one to do it for us; this breeze&#8217;ll
help to put the <i>Childe Harold</i> behind the
horizon before dawn.&#8217;</p>

<p>The vessel had, as most craft had in those
days, platforms called channels at her side,
for spreading her lower rigging. She was a
little brig. The channels sat low and were
but a step from our gunwale. I easily got
over the side with the others, and Will took
a turn with the boat&#8217;s painter to secure her.
The low moon gave no light now to see by,
the starshine was faint, and the decks of the
brig ran dark fore and aft. We made out a
house running the length of the quarter-deck.
The door was closed. Tom threw it open and
shouted long and loud. No voice answered.
Not a sound was returned in answer. You
heard nothing but the rippling of the breeze-stirred
waters along the bends. The mate
went forward and beat upon the forescuttle
and bawled, and still we got no answer.</p>

<p>It was sure we had lighted on an abandoned
ship, so far as life went; that she had
been the theatre of a tragedy and was yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
freighted with some secret horrors remained
to be discovered.</p>

<p>&#8216;Has she a boat forward, Bates?&#8217; called
Tom.</p>

<p>&#8216;No boat, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Jump into the quarter-boat, Johnstone,
and hand the things out of her. She&#8217;ll tow
astern till daylight.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There is the hand of God in this, Butler,&#8217;
said Mr. Bates, solemnly, whilst he received
the things from Will out of the boat.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is the hand out yonder amongst those
drenched sleepers?&#8217; answered Tom, sullenly
and gloomily. &#8216;Who the devil are we to sail
away with Providence? You flatter yourself,
Bates. Is everything out of that boat, Johnstone?&#8217;</p>

<p>The lad answered, &#8216;Yes,&#8217; climbed over the
side, gave the tinder-box and matches to Tom,
then helped the boat astern with the painter.</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;ll trim sail,&#8217; said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8216;What course, sir?&#8217; said the mate.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, south&mdash;south!&#8217; cried my sweetheart.
&#8216;A sure course for somewhere by-and-by;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
but to the south&#8217;ard now&mdash;to the south&#8217;ard
now!&#8217;</p>

<p>The wind was about north-east. Tom put
me to the wheel, which was fixed in the old-fashioned
style in front of the after-deck house.
My sweetheart tried the helm, then bade me
hold the spokes, and the three of them squared
the yards on the fore and the main masts.</p>

<p>It was the blackest of the dark hours, and
the brig slowly floated forward in deep shadow.
The only noise was the rippling and jerking
of the <i>Childe Harold&#8217;s</i> quarter-boat in our
wake. Will asked if he should light the binnacle
lamp. Tom said no; he&#8217;d show no
light on deck. The next thing to be done, he
said, was to sound the well and make a light
secretly in the deck-house cabin to read the
rod by. They left me at the wheel, steering
by a bright star at the starboard fore-topsail
yardarm, and after they had searched a while
gropingly for the rod, the mate put his hand
upon it. They were obliged to draw the
pump to sound. Tom and Bates then carried
the rod into the deck-house, where they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
chipped a light and read the rod by the small
glare of a sulphur match.</p>

<p>Tom came out and said to me, &#8216;There
are eighteen inches of water in the hold&mdash;nothing
to take notice of, if she&#8217;s been long
abandoned. Johnstone, you and I will take
first spell at the pump.&#8217;</p>

<p>They drew their coats off, and in a very
little while the pump was pulsing steadily to
their muscular, sailorly strokes, and the
water sobbed as it gushed to the scuppers
and spouted into the sea.</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t care what Captain Butler says,&#8217;
exclaimed Mr. Bates, standing alongside of
me, &#8216;there&#8217;s the finger of God in this!&#8217; And
he pulled off his cap and turned his face up
to the stars. &#8216;There is something solemn and
wonderful to me in this escape. Look how
it all seems to have been planned. The
drunken revelry of the convicts; the light air
of wind blowing us into sight of this craft,
then falling, as though to leave her within
reach of us; then this brig herself, instead
of an open boat&mdash;not the better for being
abandoned, though but for that she&#8217;d not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
be here. I say it&#8217;s solemn and wonderful,
and I&#8217;m grateful!&#8217; And he again upturned
his face.</p>

<p>I made no answer.</p>

<p>After a bit, the mate went to the pump,
which they plied for some twenty minutes
before dropping the rod again, when such a
sensible decrease of water was observed as to
satisfy Tom and Bates that the brig was tight.
At the expiration of half an hour they came
to the wheel to rest. Will fetched chairs out
of the deck-house and we sat, the mate keeping
the wheel steady, though he was seated;
indeed, the brig, with square yards and a sea
nigh as smooth as a plain of ice, wanted little
or no steering.</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s a big sheet of paper lying on the
cabin table,&#8217; said my cousin.</p>

<p>&#8216;A chart, perhaps,&#8217; said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8216;How did this abandonment come about?&#8217;
exclaimed Mr. Bates. &#8216;Everything&#8217;s right
aloft; I reckon the hull&#8217;s sound; she looks a
staunch little craft. What drove the men out
of her?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Are they out of her?&#8217; said Tom.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>&#8216;What do you mean?&#8217; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;I once boarded an abandoned schooner
when I was second mate,&#8217; he answered; &#8216;she
was deep with wheat. Everything was as
right with her as it is with this brig. I
looked into her forecastle and found five men
dead on her deck, and in the cabin lay a sixth
corpse. Bates, sailors hear and see so much
that they soon forget to wonder and they
never ask questions.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;True, Butler. A deal&#8217;s happened since
yesterday. And I don&#8217;t see the end of the
traverse yet.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Marian,&#8217; said Tom, &#8216;you are frightfully
tired. Oh, Bates,&#8217; he cried passionately,
&#8216;think of what this lady has undergone for
me and is still undergoing! So good, so
loyal, so&mdash;so&mdash;&mdash;&#8217; His voice broke, he ceased,
and I put my arm round his neck. &#8216;Dearest,&#8217;
he said, after a minute or two, &#8216;we&#8217;ll find a
spare sail and make you a bed in that house
there.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I couldn&#8217;t sleep. Let me be with you
till we are sure that all&#8217;s well.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;All is well.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>&#8216;I&#8217;ll wait for daybreak,&#8217; said I. &#8216;I want
to know the convict ship&#8217;s out of sight.&#8217;</p>

<p>Will went to the rail to look for her. The
rippling of the waters, parted by the brig&#8217;s
bows, was sweet as music; it was easy to
guess our speed at between three and four
knots; unless some convict&#8217;s good angel
should steer the <i>Childe Harold</i> she&#8217;d come
aback and float motionless till the self-drugged
creatures and the sailors awoke and arose and
looked around, so that by daybreak, which
was yet two hours off, we should have added
a full six miles to the five at which the brig
had been stationed when we sighted her. But
then by daybreak would there be ever a man
of the whole sodden mob equal to lifting his
eyelids, and realising how we had served
them? There was nothing to fear from that
ship and her freight; and still I would not
rest, for I wished to watch with Tom and to
behold the daybreak and view the scene of
ocean it disclosed, with my own eyes.</p>

<p>The waiting until the light of the morning
glimmered in the east was long and weary.
Yet through that time the weak breeze blew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
and the brig stemmed softly onward with a now
steady swaying of her trucks and a pendulous
flap of her canvas, for on a sudden a heave of
swell had come rolling through the ocean; it
was out of the north-west, and Mr. Bates
thought there would be wind behind it. We
talked of the people who had been sent adrift
yesterday morning, wondered how they had
fared throughout the night, whether they
would be picked up, what would become of
them. We talked of the convicts. Tom told
the mate that for three weeks the conspiracy
had been maturing; by a single word he
could have preserved the ship and the lives of
those who had been slain, and he sooner would
have torn out his tongue. I related my own
experiences; exactly acquainted Mr. Bates
with Will&#8217;s share in my stowaway adventure,
and described my sufferings in the store-room
under the forecastle. Thus we conversed;
we had much to tell.</p>

<p>Mr. Bates said that by the convicts&#8217; uprisal
he had lost about two hundred and fifty
pounds&#8217; worth of property. Tom laughed low
and savagely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>&#8216;How do I stand?&#8217; said he. &#8216;Would two
hundred and fifty pounds buy me back what
has been taken from me?&#8217; Then, giving a loud
unnatural laugh, he clapped the mate on the
back and cried, &#8216;There&#8217;ll be more than two
hundred and fifty pounds in this brig for you
as a salvage job. You came off with your life
yesterday morning. That was good. This
morning you clamber aboard more than the
value you have been plundered of. That&#8217;s
good still. Why, Bates, cheer up. Did I ever
ask if you were a married man?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I have a wife and two children, Butler.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Where do you live when you&#8217;re with them
at home?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Rotherhithe.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;D&#8217;ye remember, Bates, that I boarded the
<i>Childe Harold</i> with Miss Johnstone and this
lad in the docks? You were at the main-hatch,
and I shook hands with you, and you
asked me who was that fine girl. We&#8217;ve seen
some changes since then.&#8217; He sighed heavily
and put his hand upon mine. &#8216;Yes, I should
have known you were married, Bates. I think
you told me&mdash;was it at Callao?&mdash;of the birth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
of a little one whilst you were away. A sweet,
noble and manly calling is the sea. How it
does promote love between husbands and wives
by long separation! How faithful are sailors&#8217;
wives to their husbands ashore! How loyal
their husbands when abroad! And how munificently
does the calling of the sea reward us,
Bates! How many volumes would be needed
to contain the names of the rich sailors who
live in mansions in England and ride in
coaches! How gentle, virtuous, religious, are
the hearts which the ocean slips into the hairy
breasts of mariners! I was a good friend to
Rotch. I never knowingly spoke an ill word
to Nodder. I am innocent as surely as Christ
sits on the right hand of God! Oh, the devils!
the devils!&#8217; He started up and walked to the
bulwarks and stood motionless and silent for
many minutes.</p>

<p>None of us spoke till he rejoined us. I
longed to go to stand beside him with my arm
round his neck, but there had been a fierce
cry for loneliness in his final words, an impassioned
appeal to be left to himself in his
manner of going from us which I must have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
been deaf and blind not to have heard and
seen.</p>

<p>The dawn broke in a faint lilac all along
the eastern seaboard. We stood up to look
around. It was quickly a shining morning,
and the rim of the sea ran round the brig
flawless. Not a feather-tip of distant topmost
canvas broke the continuous sweep of the
horizon. My cousin, at Tom&#8217;s command, trotted
up into the maintopmast crosstrees, and at
that elevation surveyed the great expanse of
sea. He looked and looked, and then shouted
down that there was nothing in sight. A few
clouds in the north-west, whence the swell was
running; but the breeze was still out of the
north and east&mdash;a light wind that, with the
small canvas the brig expanded, gave us about
four knots.</p>

<p>When we saw that the ocean was bare,
we gazed with curiosity at the little ship we
were aboard of. Tom told Bates that he
reckoned her about two hundred tons. I have
her before me as though I stood on her deck
at this moment. She was brig-rigged. Her
lower masts were painted white. Her bulwarks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
were tall and pierced for six guns, three of a
side. She carried, however, but two small
carronades, one on either hand amidships, and
a small pivoted brass piece on her forecastle.
The inside of her bulwarks was painted green;
the planks of the deck were white; and she
looked a very staunch, strong, clean little ship.
A tiny caboose stood just abaft the forecastle.
Her long-boat was gone, and she was without
a boat. The after-part of her deck was filled
with a long house, with a narrow gangway on
either side to enable you to pass aft. This
house sparkled with little windows; it was
painted white and green, and a short flight of
steps conducted you to the roof, that was
somewhat elegantly protected by a brass rail.
Everything that met the eye was fine and
smart. The harness cask, for instance, was
handsome and hooped with brass; the binnacle
was as pretty a quarter-deck ornament
as ever I saw; the rigging was good, the sails
fairly new, and all things in their place. The
keen eyes of Tom and Mr. Bates found nothing
amiss anywhere. Yet she had a somewhat
mildewed look, as of a craft that had been for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
some time drifting about without men, and in
a short hencoop on the main-deck lay eight or
nine dead cocks and hens.</p>

<p>Tom overhung her side, and said that she
was black, with a gilt line running her length.
He sounded the well when the light came, and
found the water exactly at the height at which
it had stood when they had left off pumping.</p>

<p>&#8216;Bates,&#8217; said he, &#8216;we&#8217;ll get that quarter-boat
aboard presently. First let&#8217;s overhaul
the vessel and see what sort of yarn about herself
she can spin us. Will, hold the wheel. My
lad, you look half dead; you used not to look
so when we went our walks with Marian. You
shall take rest soon&mdash;but there&#8217;s something
to be done first.&#8217;</p>

<p>He picked up my bundle of clothes off the
deck, and I and Mr. Bates followed him into
the deck-house.</p>

<p>Here all was as bright and clean as though
the brig were fresh from the hands of the
artificers. The sunshine streamed through a
central skylight. I counted six cabin-doors,
three of a side. The furniture consisted of
an oblong table, chairs, a couple of lamps, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
tell-tale compass, and other such matters.
The first thing that took our sight was a large
square of paper nailed to the table. It was
the back of a white chart, and upon it was a
quantity of writing in a large, sprawling hand.
Tom twisted it round without pulling it from
the nail, and the mate and I stood beside him
and gazed at the giant missive. Close to
where the paper was perforated was the drawing
of a coffin; upon the coffin lid in relief
was sketched the figure of a man. The face
of the man was undoubtedly a portrait. It
was a rude performance, but good. To the
left was a skull, well done; to the right, cross-bones.
Under &#8216;To all concerned,&#8217; Tom read
aloud:</p>

<p>&#8216;This brig is the <i>Old Stormy</i>, of Liverpool,
bound to Cape Town with a small general
cargo. John Wilson, master (his portrait&#8217;s
on the coffin); William Nash, mate, now
mince-mate, and thanks be to God for the
smallest kindness shown to sailors.</p>

<p>&#8216;We sailed out of the Mersey. Our ship&#8217;s
company was five seamen and a cook. The
provisions were middling good till we got out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
to sea, then the little that was sweet had been
scoffed, and what came next was rot and
stench&mdash;rot in the bread-bag where the worms
were and stench in the harness cask where the
meat was.</p>

<p>&#8216;We had been promised a daily allowance
of rum. Clear of Soundings the rum gave
out. The captain said there had been a mistake
in the shipping of the stuff, and we got
no more.</p>

<p>&#8216;But what was this to his and the mate&#8217;s
usage of us? To you, if it concerns you, the
bleeding mongrel, half-stripped by the mange,
gone mad and chased with pitchfork and
brickbat, was tenderly served, compared with
us forecastle hands.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yet we kept all on turning to, and we
endured till patience dropped dead and Cain
stepped aboard. It happened just to the
nor&#8217;ard of the Equator, and when it was
over there were six pale men left, but never
a thumb-nail width of mess. No, and there&#8217;d
been no noise. No, and swift was the job.
Next thing to be done was to get away out of
it. Vom-us! was the word. Not a man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
could measure the sun&#8217;s height, so we&#8217;ve
agreed to go. And our reasons are twenty.
You, if you&#8217;re concerned, find them out. So
here I sit, on a Friday night, writing this down
as a warning with a moral in its tail: Take
heed, all you ruffian skippers and mates, how
you ill-treat good men.</p>

<p class="right">&#8216;W. M., A.B.&#8217;</p>

<p>Tom ceased, and we looked at one
another.</p>

<p>&#8216;The man who wrote that never sailed in
a ship&#8217;s forecastle,&#8217; said Mr. Bates.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why not?&#8217; said Tom. &#8216;There was a
University man before the mast in one of my
ships. Is it the education here that palls ye?
I believe every word of it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Butler, the brig&#8217;s been boarded,&#8217; said Mr. Bates,
&#8216;and found abandoned, and some joker
scrawled out this piece of humour before
leaving.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I believe every word of it,&#8217; repeated Tom,
running his eye over this huge ocean address
to those concerned. &#8216;How long would it take
you to draw those things and think and write<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
this out? No man would come prepared with
it. Where&#8217;d he get the facts? We&#8217;ll look for
the papers.&#8217; He tried to draw the nail, broke
the sheet from it, glanced at the other side
(the Portuguese coast) and rolled it up.</p>

<p>The foremost berth on the port side had
been the captain&#8217;s. Seemingly nothing had
been touched. Some clothes hung against the
bulkhead; there was bedding in the narrow
fore and aft bunk. All the necessary appliances
for the navigation of the vessel were
here: Two good chronometers snugly stowed
in hair in a locker, a sextant and a quadrant,
mathematical instruments, such charts as the
voyage might demand, and the needful navigating
books. A little hinged table stood
open in a corner; upon it was a plain writing-desk
with the key in the lock, and inside a
parcel of letters in a woman&#8217;s writing, some
note-paper and a bag of sovereigns, which
Tom counted and made twenty-two.</p>

<p>&#8216;Where&#8217;s the log-book?&#8217; said Mr. Bates.</p>

<p>&#8216;Here&#8217;ll be her papers,&#8217; said Tom, after
opening a locker.</p>

<p>He pulled out a tin box and read the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
papers with the quickness of a man used to
such documents.</p>

<p>&#8216;This is the brig <i>Old Stormy</i>,&#8217; said he.
&#8216;Two hundred and twelve tons&mdash;cargo consigned
to Cape Town&mdash;a rich freight!&#8217; he
added, whistling low, &#8216;pianos, pictures, vases,
books, furniture, clocks, ornaments, clothes,
and linen.&#8217;</p>

<p>Then he read out by whom the goods had
been shipped, and to whom they were consigned.
The name of the master was John
Wilson, of the mate William Nash, and W.
M. might be the seaman down as William
Metcalfe.</p>

<p>The berth opposite had been the mate&#8217;s;
here was found the vessel&#8217;s log-book, from
the last entry in which we discovered that the
<i>Old Stormy</i> had been abandoned about a
fortnight since, a few leagues north of the
Equator, so that she had drifted in that time
to the southward through several degrees of
latitude. This might very well have happened,
seeing the canvas she was under. Two berths
on the port side were empty, though equipped
for use. I mean there were bunks and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
other berth furniture. On the starboard side
the two cabins abaft the mate&#8217;s we found
respectively fitted as a store-room and pantry.
All the provisions for cabin use appeared to
have been stowed in the store-room, and the
little pantry was as well-stocked in crockery,
glass, and the like as the <i>Childe Harold&#8217;s</i> before
the convicts broke it up.</p>

<p>This survey was quickly made. Tom said:</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s plenty to eat for four people and
good rooms to sleep in. What&#8217;ll be the stock
of fresh water? That&#8217;s next with us, Bates.
Then pump her out and whip the quarter-boat
aboard.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s a solemn and wonderful deliverance,&#8217;
exclaimed Mr. Bates.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s lucky,&#8217; said Tom, coldly. He looked
at the mate and burst out fiercely: &#8216;Get
sentenced as an innocent man to the hulks,
and all the gratitude you&#8217;ll be capable of
afterward shall fill the skin of a flea.&#8217; Then
controlling himself he added: &#8216;You&#8217;ll have
been a reader of the shipping papers in your
day, Bates. There&#8217;s nothing of the miraculous
in the derelict. How many after this and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
bigger patterns are fallen in within a year?&#8217;
He then said to me: &#8216;Marian, here are your
clothes. Which cabin do you choose?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Choose one for me, Tom.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The best,&#8217; said he; and he carried my
bundle into the cabin which we had first
explored.</p>

<p>I said nothing; his will was my law; he
could have broken my heart by a fierce look
or an angry speech.</p>

<p>&#8216;You have worn this masquerade too
long,&#8217; said he, putting his hand upon it. &#8216;It
unsexes my noble girl. Here is everything
for comfort. I will fetch you water. I want
to see my Marian refreshed and dressed&mdash;my
proud and handsome girl again&mdash;as she was
when I deserved her.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Tom, you thank me sadly for following
you. Deserve me! Never was man loved
as you are now. And you reproach me for
following you? Suppose I had taken the
next ship. The outbreak has happened in
the meantime. We should have been separated
for ever.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;d have found you! I&#8217;d have found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
you!&#8217; he cried, passionately pulling me to
him and kissing me, heedless of Mr. Bates,
who stood in the open door looking about
him; but, indeed, I minded as little as Tom
that the mate should see us.</p>

<p>My sweetheart went out, and presently
returned with a bucket of sparkling brine.</p>

<p>&#8216;Now, Marian,&#8217; said he, &#8216;see to yourself
whilst we see to the brig. Come along, Bates.
She&#8217;s but two hundred and twelve tons, and
there are three of us.&#8217;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIX<br />


<small>SHE RELATES HOW HER SWEETHEART RESOLVES
TO HIDE IN AN ISLAND</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> salt water refreshed me greatly, and my
cheeks burned like roses and my eyes shone
when I had dried myself. A square of mirror
hung near the washstand. I had thought to
see myself looking ill and yellow and wretched;
and my breast swelled at sight of my handsome,
sparkling face, so proud did my beauty
make me feel for Tom&#8217;s sake.</p>

<p>And yet I was now grown so used to my
male attire that when I had clothed myself in
my Woolwich dress, as I call it&mdash;and scarcely
less strange than my own were the fortunes
of this bundle of apparel&mdash;I found myself
very uneasy. I missed the freedom of my
legs. I don&#8217;t wonder that women should
struggle from time to time to invent a dress
that gives their limbs the liberty which men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
enjoy. However, I clothed myself very carefully,
and when I had put on my hat I thought I
looked the saucier and more piquant for my
hair being cropped short. Do not call this
egotism. It is my way of telling the story.
I who relate it am old, and my youth and
beauty are as the dust of half a century.</p>

<p>When I was dressed I stepped out to be
of help. Will was at the little wheel in front
of the house. He gave a jump and his dear
face brightened up.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hang me,&#8217; he cried, &#8216;if that dress don&#8217;t
bring Stepney close aboard! It is but a step
to the Tower, surely! And when my trick&#8217;s
up we&#8217;ll go a-rambling Epping way.&#8217;</p>

<p>Tom and the mate were at work at the
pump. Tom kissed his hand and the mate
lifted his cap. A few minutes later the water
ceased to flow.</p>

<p>&#8216;A tight little ship!&#8217; cried Tom; and he
and Mr. Bates came to me.</p>

<p>&#8216;D&#8217;ye remember her now, Bates?&#8217; said my
sweetheart, looking at me proudly and with
love.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes. And to think that I should have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
bullied you on the poop, Miss Johnstone,
when your cousin brought you to ask me for
a bed! I beg your pardon now,&#8217; said the
worthy fellow, and he slowly bowed low.</p>

<p>&#8216;Marian,&#8217; said Tom, &#8216;I wished you to rest;
but you look so brisk I&#8217;ll allow you to keep
awake for another hour. Hold this little
wheel and keep the brig&#8217;s head just as it is.
There&#8217;s much for the three of us to do, and,
chiefest of all, there&#8217;s breakfast to get.&#8217;</p>

<p>I took the wheel and they went to work,
and first they got the quarter-boat&#8217;s sail out
of her and stretched it over my head as a
shelter from the sun. This done, they hoisted
the quarter-boat. Will found the carpenter&#8217;s
chest, split up some wood, went into the
fore-peak for coal and lighted the galley fire.
Whilst this was doing Tom and Bates searched
the brig and found her stock of fresh water in
a considerable quantity just under the main-hatch.
They explored the forecastle, but met
with nothing to tell them whether the story
on the cabin table was true or not. The
sailors had left their blankets, but taken their
traps. They were British sailors, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
weight of their clothes was not very likely to
imperil the safety of the boat.</p>

<p>The morning was brilliantly beautiful;
the breeze almost astern, the swell on the
quarter, and the brig softly and silently rippled
onward, gently heaving and breathing
as she went, as she lifted with the long ocean
folds flowing in pale blue out of the north-west.
I found it easy to steer. The little vessel, like
a thoroughbred to the lightest pressure of its
rein, answered to a movement of the spokes; I
held the course as I found it dead to the
lubber&#8217;s mark; indeed, I think it is easier to
steer with a wheel than a tiller.</p>

<p>I sank into a deep reflection over what
had passed since yester-morning. Did I feel
grateful for the mercies vouchsafed&mdash;mercies
linked like miracles, so wonderfully and inexpressibly
fortunate to us had the incidents
since the outbreak proved in their succession
down to this, our lighting upon an equipped,
well-stocked, sound, and abandoned vessel? I
fear I was not grateful. I did not lift up my
heart in a single syllable of thanks. My spirit
was savage with memory, spite of our gracious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
and consoling fortune; my passion for Tom
overmastered me; as he felt, so I felt; what
was in his mind that I could find in his eyes
and speech instantly filled and possessed my
own mind. Had he knelt in prayer I should
have knelt; but he had told Mr. Bates that
gratitude lay dead in him, so it slept in me.
Luck had befallen us; but so much had gone
before which was not luck, except it were of
the devil&#8217;s sort, that I raged when I thought
of it, and felt that nothing ever could happen
good enough to thank Heaven for.</p>

<p>Will, who acted as cook this first morning,
prepared a tolerable breakfast. Coffee
had been found and marmalade; the lad fried
a dish of the <i>Childe Harold&#8217;s</i> ham, and these
things with biscuit and sugar furnished us
with a meal. The provisions we had brought
with us from the convict ship had been stowed
by Bates and Tom in the store-room. Had
we met with nothing on board, that stock we
had come with would have lasted a month or
six weeks.</p>

<p>I spied three eggs amongst the dead hens
in the coop, and told Mr. Bates of them; they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
were the last efforts of the poor, unhappy,
starved poultry. The mate wondered that the
rats had spared them and the birds. He
picked them up and Will cooked them, and
they proved&mdash;ah! I laughed to see Mr. Bates
holding his nose and throwing the cocks and
hens overboard; such work fitted ill with the
dignity of a man who was just now chief
officer of one of the finest of the Blackwall
liners.</p>

<p>That we might break our fast together
whilst one of us steered, the dishes and cups
were set upon the deck and we used our knees
for tables. The brig went along so quietly
that you could let go of the wheel for minutes
at a time, without a quarter-point of deflection
in the compass bearing. We were hungry
and thirsty; the boat&#8217;s sail overhead cast a
pleasant shade upon us; the breeze blew
through the little gangway on either hand of
the house and fanned us whilst we breakfasted.</p>

<p>Mr. Bates and Will talked much of the
convict ship, of the chance of her people, and
the like. Tom sat quiet, and I thought moody.
Often he fastened his eyes upon me, but with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
a look as though he saw something beyond.
I feared that he was overwrought and dead
wearied, and I longed to pillow his head on
my arm that I might watch him sleeping.
All on a sudden he flushed up and, with a
hard, small, satiric smile, whilst his eyes
seemed to brighten into fire as though taking
light from the contrast of the blood in his
cheeks, he cried:</p>

<p>&#8216;Bates&mdash;but what right have I to call you
Bates? I should &#8220;mister&#8221; you, hey?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, Tom, dear!&#8217; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, see here, now,&#8217; he continued, and
he spoke fiercely: &#8216;I&#8217;m a convict, Bates.
There&#8217;s no getting away from that. Do you
call this liberty? No more than the liberty
of a wretch who breaks from a hulk, who&#8217;s a
convict while he swims, who&#8217;s a convict when
he lands, who goes to his grave a convict,
though he keeps free.&#8217;</p>

<p>The mate looked at me with alarm.</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re a good fellow. I believe,&#8217; Tom
went on, &#8216;and you think me a wronged,
innocent man. But I&#8217;m a convict always.
Why, haven&#8217;t you watched me whilst I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
tramped in a gang to the tune of a fiddle,
watched me at a felon&#8217;s work about the deck
of the ship you were chief mate of, watched
me with the irons upon my legs as I shuffled
out of the hatch to the cries of a brother-convict?
You&#8217;re a respectable man&mdash;oh, very
respectable! So was I once, but they swore
my liberty and honour away and broke my
heart. Doesn&#8217;t this association with a convict
and his familiar accost of you as &#8220;Bates&#8221; shock
your respectability?&#8217;</p>

<p>I could not bear his wild looks nor to hear
more. I flung my arms round his neck and
burst into tears.</p>

<p>&#8216;Butler,&#8217; said the mate, &#8216;this is uncalled-for.
What you were when I first knew you,
you still are. A more honourable heart never
beat in a sailor&#8217;s breast. Did they make me
a convict yesterday by clothing me as one?
No more they made you a malefactor by
sentencing you. Soothe the poor lady and
give me your hand, old man.&#8217;</p>

<p>I drew my arms from Tom. He took the
mate&#8217;s hand and stooped his head to it. Will,
whose face worked with sympathy and distress,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
motioned to me as though he would have me
give my sweetheart time to rally. Presently
Tom lifted his face. Tears were in his eyes,
likewise an expression that warned me not to
seem to heed him. The mate, with the tact
of a gentleman, talked to Will about Captain
Sutherland, whose lady he knew. He named
certain ships which Sutherland had commanded.
Thus he gossiped on, meanwhile
proceeding with his breakfast.</p>

<p>Tom got up and walked to the bulwarks,
and stood looking at the sea over the rail. I
watched him with impassionate anxiety. I
could not gauge his mood, and knew not
what dreadful impulse might suddenly govern
him. He rejoined us, and said, looking at
the mate:</p>

<p>&#8216;Your wish, of course, is to return to your
wife and children?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No unnatural wish, I hope, Butler,&#8217; answered
Mr. Bates, forcing a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8216;What is to be done?&#8217; exclaimed Tom,
measuring a short length of deck with swift
paces. &#8216;There&#8217;s no home for me to return
to. I hate the thought of England. Let<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
me establish my innocence, and still I detest
England.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Establish your innocence,&#8217; said the mate,
&#8216;and they&#8217;ll grant you a free pardon, and
the old country would be as it ever was to
you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Grant me a free pardon!&#8217; cried Tom,
stopping in his walk and looking at the mate.
&#8216;What am I to be pardoned for? Sins I
never committed! Pardon me? Curse them!
Where would I go? I must think. Give me
a globe of the world. Stab through England&mdash;through
the heart of that little bog of land
that bands and irons and exiles its honourable
toilers&mdash;and where the point comes on out
t&#8217;other side is the spot I&#8217;d choose, if you
grant me but a rock there to live on.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;My dear Butler,&#8217; exclaimed Bates, &#8216;there
is no need for me to assure you, I hope, that
I quite see how you are situated. You have
your liberty, and you must keep it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Aye, indeed!&#8217; cried I.</p>

<p>&#8216;You must sail to some place where you&#8217;ll
be safe,&#8217; continued the mate. &#8216;I owe you
my life, and with your leave I&#8217;ll stick to you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
till I see you safe. We&#8217;re brother-sailors,
Butler. I know what&#8217;s expected of me, and
I know my own heart.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Mr. Bates, I thank you,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;It won&#8217;t be human to carry you where
I shall wish to go!&#8217; exclaimed Tom. &#8216;They&#8217;ll
get news of the convict ship at home, and
your wife will think you dead. And, then,
here&#8217;s Johnstone.&#8217; He placed his hand upon
the lad&#8217;s shoulder. &#8216;Must I carry him about
with me till I&#8217;ve fixed a spot? He&#8217;s got a
good home and fond parents. And then
there&#8217;s his calling. Why, what kind of a
precious outlook is this sort of thing for
man, boy, or beast?&#8217; he exclaimed, with a
sneer.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s seeing the world,&#8217; said Will.</p>

<p>Tom laughed, but with no face of merriment.</p>

<p>&#8216;What place is in your mind, Butler?&#8217;
said the mate.</p>

<p>My sweetheart made no answer; his eyes
were fixed upon me. Bates repeated his
question, and still Tom gazed at me in silence.</p>

<p>&#8216;Marian,&#8217; said he presently, &#8216;you are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
with me, dearest. Is it your wish to remain
with me?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Where you go I must go, if you would
not break my heart.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s there to prevent your living in
England, Captain Butler?&#8217; here interrupted
Will. &#8216;Aren&#8217;t there wilds and solitudes
in England in which a man could burrow
as secretly as in the loneliest island in the
ocean?&#8217;</p>

<p>I frowned, observing Tom&#8217;s face, and bade
the boy hold his tongue.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;d run no risks if I were you, Butler,&#8217;
said Mr. Bates. &#8216;Would ye take a suggestion
or two amiss?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What d&#8217;ye want to say, Bates?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;ll want a place where there are no
English. No need to lift the Southern Cross
into view to find it.&#8217; He looked at me.
&#8216;There are scores of villages in Spain, away
over in Austria and Hungary, down in Italy
and other Mediterranean nations, in any one
of which, under any sort of colour you
choose to fly, you&#8217;d flourish as secure&mdash;you
and this lady as your wife&mdash;as if you mined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
a lodging for yourselves in a Galapagos
rock.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;ll not live in Europe,&#8217; said I; &#8216;London
is always too close there.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;London&#8217;s the safest place in the world to
hide in,&#8217; said Will.</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t talk of hiding,&#8217; cried I, angrily.</p>

<p>&#8216;Bates,&#8217; said Tom, turning his eyes from
me to the mate, &#8216;it&#8217;s under the Southern
Cross you named just now that I mean to
seek my lodging for life. Since it&#8217;s come to
this, I would to God this lady were my wife.
But it&#8217;s to be brought about. Patience!
Patience! Oh, Bates, how often have I
whispered this word &#8220;patience&#8221; to myself!
But the consideration kinks the line for running,
Bates. Long ago my mind was resolved
that if ever I stole or got my liberty and had
this true heart at my side, I&#8217;d dwell in the
middle of the ocean in the very loneliest of
the islands that are washed by salt water.
D&#8217;ye know Tristan d&#8217;Acunha?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Tristan d&#8217;Acunha!&#8217; muttered Will, staring
at me.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s inhabited,&#8217; said Tom. &#8216;I&#8217;ve been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
ashore there, talked with Corporal Glass, sat
in his house, made him presents.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;An Englishman?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Once an English soldier, getting on to be
an old man now, Marian; ill of a cancer that
will kill him; an honest man who&#8217;ll welcome
us. But there&#8217;s no clergyman; there was
none in my time.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The Cape isn&#8217;t many weeks off,&#8217; said
Bates.</p>

<p>&#8216;No, and that&#8217;s in my mind, too. There
are parsons there,&#8217; said Tom, &#8216;and vessels to
carry us to the island again; you and Will &#8217;ll
take the salvage you&#8217;ll get on this brig at
Cape Town, and so home.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;English men-of-war touch at Tristan,&#8217;
said Will.</p>

<p>&#8216;One in about eighteen years; whalers
often enough, Marian, to find us fresh safety
in the South Seas should a fit of flitting take
us. There are goods under here,&#8217; said he,
stamping the deck, &#8216;that&#8217;ll earn us a cordial
hand-grip at Tristan. They&#8217;ll represent my
share of the salvage. Why, it&#8217;s right that a
convict should take what he wants, hey,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
Bates? My life will be in your hands, of
course.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I wish there was no other risk,&#8217; said the
mate.</p>

<p>&#8216;Marian, this is not my scheme of this
moment,&#8217; said Tom, sitting down beside me.
&#8216;I found it there,&#8217; said he, pointing to the sea
and meaning the convict ship. &#8216;But a new
thought has come out of Bates&#8217;s words;
we&#8217;ll touch at the island and I&#8217;ll have a talk
with Glass, get help to carry us to a port,
and we&#8217;ll return in a hired craft man and
wife.&#8217;</p>

<p>I gave him my hand to hold; I could
have wept with happiness to hear him talk
thus. I had feared throughout that, loving
me too well to yoke me to his fate, he would
oblige me to go home with Will and the mate,
and hide himself alone.</p>

<p>&#8216;Are you in earnest, Butler?&#8217; said Mr.
Bates.</p>

<p>&#8216;Brutally in earnest.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Saints, Marian! What&#8217;ll father and mother
think to hear of you as living on Tristan
d&#8217;Acunha?&#8217; cried Will.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>&#8216;That&#8217;s where it is!&#8217; exclaimed Tom
fiercely, rounding upon the boy, &#8216;I shan&#8217;t be
safe!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Not as my cousin&#8217;s husband?&#8217; said Will.
&#8216;Who&#8217;d talk?&#8217;</p>

<p>I frowned to silence him. I wanted no ill
feeling between these two.</p>

<p>&#8216;Who&#8217;s this Glass you speak of, Butler?&#8217;
said the mate.</p>

<p>&#8216;When Cloete&#8217;s garrison was withdrawn,
Glass was left as a volunteer in charge of a
wreck and some military stores. That was in
&#8217;24. Two seamen of the St. Helena squadron
settled on the island with him. You know,
of course, that Tristan was occupied by a
detachment of our artillery while Bonaparte
was at St. Helena?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Where did they find wives?&#8217; said the
mate.</p>

<p>&#8216;Glass brought a mulatto woman from
the Cape; the other settlers got negresses
from St. Helena. The population was about
forty when I was there; though some of the
women are well-built and handsome, their
complexions run from milk to chocolate.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>&#8216;Suppose the convicts steer foul of the
island,&#8217; said Will.</p>

<p>&#8216;Any houses?&#8217; said the mate.</p>

<p>&#8216;Cottages. They build them with blocks
of lava.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s to eat there?&#8217; inquired the mate,
who listened with a sober face of interest.</p>

<p>&#8216;I can&#8217;t tell off-hand; fish and potatoes,
I know; there&#8217;s a little fruit; they grow
crops, and Glass told me of a number of wild
goats and spoke of so many heads of cattle
belonging to some of the people, along with
poultry and pigs.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We shan&#8217;t starve,&#8217; said I, laughing.</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s over eight thousand feet high of
rock for me to hide under, Marian; and away
down in the mightiest of all ocean solitudes
too&mdash;&#8217;twixt the two Capes&mdash;and the climate&#8217;s
delicious.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Who&#8217;ll cash cheques there for you,
Marian?&#8217; said Will.</p>

<p>&#8216;Tom,&#8217; said I, &#8216;one question I&#8217;ll ask&mdash;what&#8217;ll
be your story to the Governor
Glass?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay,&#8217; said he, &#8216;that&#8217;ll be for you and me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
to think out. Bates, there may be fifty
respectable reasons why a man should loathe
what&#8217;s called his native country and expatriate
himself. Or call it a whim. My
wife and I,&#8217; said he, fondling my hand and
faintly smiling as he looked at me, &#8216;have a
mind to live in mid-ocean. Whose business
but ours is that? I&#8217;ve lost my ship. I&#8217;m a
broken-hearted bankrupt. Who&#8217;ll give me
the lie? My brave girl loves me, and nothing
must separate us. And so, Governor Glass, I
say, with your good leave, I&#8217;ll sail away and
get married, and come back to you with my
bride. Eh!&#8217; he cried, looking eagerly and
hotly from Bates to Will. &#8216;There&#8217;s no lie
there, I believe?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, sir, you have the yarn!&#8217; exclaimed
my cousin.</p>

<p>&#8216;Johnstone spoke of cashing a cheque at
Tristan,&#8217; said Bates, with a grin, which vanished
in an earnest look. &#8216;I shall get home,
I hope, and if I can be of the least use&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, thank ye, Bates; thank ye,&#8217; interrupted
Tom. &#8216;We&#8217;re bound to go to civilisation
to get married, you know, and there&#8217;ll be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
Miss Johnstone&#8217;s opportunity for making the
arrangements she may think proper.&#8217;</p>

<p>The mate gravely bowed his head.</p>

<p>&#8216;Marian, get to your cabin, dearest, and
rest,&#8217; said Tom.</p>

<p>He rose, and I rose instantly with him.
He took me by the hand, and we entered the
berth he had bid me use. He tossed the
bedding out of the bunk, leaving the mattress,
which was new and clean.</p>

<p>&#8216;Sleep, dear one,&#8217; said he. &#8216;God knows
you need it.&#8217;</p>

<p>I was about to speak. He checked me,
and said that rest was needful; that there
was work to be done outside; that if he
began to talk he&#8217;d keep me waking for hours,
so full was his mind; then kissed and left me.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XL<br />


<small>SHE HELPS TO KEEP WATCH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I got</span> into the bunk, but it was long before I
fell asleep. The light was brilliant. The
port was open, but the wind was aft and
breezed through the gangways, and but little
entered the cabin. I lay thinking over Tom&#8217;s
talk with the others, and my spirits danced
and my heart beat with happiness. Isolation!
There could be none where Tom was. And
then we should be man and wife before he
settled down upon that wonderful, remote,
heaven-kissing island of the South Atlantic.
My imagination made a paradise of it. I
figured a handful of quaint cottages, a little
community of people simple of heart, pure of
life; I dreamed of wild-fowl gaily painted, of
the huge breakers of the Atlantic roaring in
foam and ramparting our ocean hiding-place,
of sweet, cold fruit in volcanic hollows, and a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
monstrous mountain marble-topped with snow.
A hundred like imaginations made up the
picture. But above all&mdash;but above all&mdash;was
the promise of Tom&#8217;s safety in that mid-ocean
island; no other visitors than rough whale-men;
in eighteen or twenty years but one
man-of-war, and always the world on either
hand, the Capes for choice of fresh retreats,
any one of them as happy as a dream of
Heaven to me whilst Tom should be at my
side.</p>

<p>I awoke exceedingly refreshed. I guessed
by the colour of the light that the afternoon
was far advanced. The door of the cabin
opposite stood hooked open, and in the bunk
in that berth lay Tom sound asleep. I crept
to his side and gazed at him. His expression
was wild, as though some violent dream
troubled his brain; his lips stirred and he
breathed hard and short, frowning sometimes,
with a tremble in his eyelids as though he
was about to look at me. I put my lips to
his forehead, whereupon he sighed deeply,
ceased to mutter, and his face took an expression
of repose.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>Fearing to break his rest, I softly stepped
out.</p>

<p>Some cold meat, biscuit, and other food
were upon the table. Through the deck-house
window I spied the head of Will standing
at the wheel. I was hungry, and cut
some beef and quickly made a meal, meaning
to relieve Will at the wheel. A bottle of wine
stood on a swing tray. I drank half a wine-glass
of it. It was an excellent cordial sherry
or Madeira brought from the store-room,
where I had observed a number of such bottles.</p>

<p>When Will saw me he exclaimed, &#8216;You
have had a fine sleep! Your cheeks are red
with it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How long have you been standing here?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;About an hour. I relieved Butler, who
is lying down in one of the cabins.&#8217;</p>

<p>Mr. Bates at that moment came out of the
caboose. He grinned as he walked aft and
said, in his slow way, &#8216;I never expected to
turn cook when I shipped as chief officer, Miss
Johnstone. But the galley fire must be seen
to if we&#8217;re to have hot water for a cup of tea.
You seem the better for your sleep.&#8217; And he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
stationed himself alongside of me, first casting
a look upon the compass and then glancing
aloft.</p>

<p>The breeze had freshened whilst I slept;
the swell was no stronger, but now the wind
was freckling it with little featherings and
dartings of foam. The brig was making good
way, and hissed smartly onward. The west
was rich with hot colours, and the sun hung
there in a rayless, swollen mass, not distorted,
but so huge that it filled me with wonder.
Many little clouds, coloured to the complexion
of blood, sailed across our mast-heads into
the deepening violet of the east, where the
ocean flowed like a sea of gilt&mdash;a marvellous
contrast with the blue it brimmed to. &#8216;It
reminds me,&#8217; said Mr. Bates, pointing to it, &#8216;of
a Chinese plain in the rice harvest.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We are under the sail of the morning,&#8217;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; he answered. &#8216;But I expect we&#8217;ll
roll up the topgallant-sail and mainsail when
Butler wakes up.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Shall the four of us be able to manage
till we reach Tristan?&#8217; said I.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>Mr. Bates gazed at me thoughtfully without
speech.</p>

<p>&#8216;Marian,&#8217; said my cousin, &#8216;can&#8217;t you get
this island scheme out of Butler&#8217;s head?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I like it!&#8217; I cried quickly.</p>

<p>&#8216;The island&#8217;s a long way off,&#8217; said Mr. Bates.</p>

<p>&#8216;How far?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;About two thousand miles, Miss Johnstone.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How long will it take us to get there?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Perhaps a fortnight, perhaps a month,&#8217;
answered Mr. Bates.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m jolly sorry now,&#8217; said Will, sinking
his voice, &#8216;that we fell in with this brig. Not
but that she isn&#8217;t deucedly useful and the very
bucket to pray for&mdash;with such a cargo in her
hold to salve, too, not to speak of the hooker
herself&mdash;if it wasn&#8217;t for that smothering island
of Tristan. But you&#8217;re never in earnest in
deciding to settle there?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Shall we be able to manage without further
help, Mr. Bates?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why,&#8217; said he, &#8216;it&#8217;ll be a tight fit. You&#8217;re
pleased to speak of four of us.&#8217; He smiled
and gazed up at the masts. &#8216;Call us three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
sailors and four helmsmen. But at sea what
must be done often will be done.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;If Captain Butler will let me wear my
boy&#8217;s clothes,&#8217; said I, &#8216;I&#8217;ll go aloft and try to
be of use. But you can&#8217;t climb in petticoats,
Mr. Bates.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Marian, Butler will do anything for you,&#8217;
said Will. &#8216;Clap a purchase on his love and
rouse this beastly island scheme out of him.
We want to get home.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Who?&#8217; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;Mr. Bates and I.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I am pledged to stand by Captain Butler,
Johnstone,&#8217; said the mate. &#8216;He saved my life,
and I&#8217;ll stick to him till he sees his way to let
me go.&#8217;</p>

<p>I seized the worthy man&#8217;s hand and pressed
it.</p>

<p>&#8216;Will,&#8217; said I, &#8216;were you to live to be a
hundred, the whole of the wishes of your long
life would weigh with me no more than a
grain of sand against Tom&#8217;s safety.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But will he be safe at Tristan?&#8217; cried
Will.</p>

<p>&#8216;Where would you carry him?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>&#8216;Anywhere but to Tristan,&#8217; answered the
lad. &#8216;Won&#8217;t the man, Glass, that he talks of,
discover who he is? Everything leaks out,
even away down on a mangy rock in the
middle of the sea. You&#8217;ll blab in a nightmare.
They&#8217;ll not keep a convict&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Never call him that, Will, or I&#8217;ll kill
you!&#8217; I shrieked, rounding upon him in one
of my old swelling fits of rage, breast heaving,
eyes sparkling, cheeks on fire.</p>

<p>&#8216;I meant no insult!&#8217; exclaimed Will.
&#8216;Butler&#8217;s as innocent as I. I spoke of him as
they&#8217;d think of him down in that island if they
found out who he was. Or, let him hide
there if he chooses. Is such an island as
Tristan fit for you to live and die on&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, Mr. Bates,&#8217; I exclaimed, passionately,
&#8216;Will knows what I have sacrificed, what I
have suffered, and he talks now as if I did not
love Tom!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Come and take the air on top of this
deck-house, Miss Johnstone,&#8217; said the mate.
&#8216;We shall disturb Captain Butler if we stand
here.&#8217;</p>

<p>My temper, however, soon cooled. I loved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
my cousin too heartily to be long angry with
him. He was little more than a boy, too.
He believed in Tom&#8217;s innocence, and had not
meant to pain me. Mr. Bates and I walked
with soft tread on the roof of the deck-house
that Tom might sleep. Up there we got the
full sweep of the breeze and a wide sight of
the sea. I watched the magnificent picture
of the dying day, the perishing glories in the
west, the liquid gloom in the east with a
trembling star just above the water-line
shining like the white lantern of a lighthouse,
and I conversed earnestly with the mate on
Tom&#8217;s scheme, explained that in any case he
and I must go into hiding, and that the safest
retreat must be the best, even though it should
be a barren, melancholy rock in the middle of
the ocean.</p>

<p>&#8216;He was sentenced to fourteen years,&#8217; said
I. &#8216;If he returns before his time is up, and
is caught, he will be transported for life.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; said the mate, &#8216;he told me that.
And not long since it was a hanging offence.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But what would be his punishment if
they caught him now?&#8217; said I. &#8216;He, a convict,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
consents to take charge of a ship seized
by convicts! They&#8217;d prove him a ringleader
and kill him.&#8217;</p>

<p>I walked and talked for about half an
hour with this kind and worthy man, told
him a great deal about my early days, of my
first meeting with Tom at Uncle Johnstone&#8217;s,
and entered at large upon my reasons for
sailing in my sweetheart&#8217;s ship as a stowaway
instead of following him in a passenger vessel.
I then got him to talk about his own life and
of his wife and his children, and whilst we
walked the evening drew down.</p>

<p>The brig was now rushing forward at a
fine pace. Her topsails were large sails and
her maintopgallant-sail was set, the weather
clew of the mainsail was up, the lee clew aft,
the staysails were down, the trysail brailed
up, and the only sail aforemast was the fore-topmast
staysail. The wind had quartered
the brig, and under her wide wings and over
the smooth western heave that was now
shrilly ridging the vessel drove along.</p>

<p>&#8216;She is a fine little ship,&#8217; said Mr. Bates,
standing with me at the after end of the deck-house.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
&#8216;Our lighting upon her is a wonderful
and solemn thing, and perhaps, after all,
we shall one day learn that she was derelict
for the reasons related in that queer letter we
found below.&#8217;</p>

<p>Just then Tom came up the ladder. He
held my hands whilst he asked me if I had
slept well.</p>

<p>&#8216;My nap has made a new man of me,&#8217; he
said. &#8216;What&#8217;s the weather going to be?
Bates, there&#8217;s a frisky spit in the water, isn&#8217;t
there? But there&#8217;s no weight of wind as yet
to hurt. Let&#8217;s give her all she&#8217;ll take. She
walks, by Jericho! A fortnight of this will be
bringing the corporal aboard.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What shall I do? Make me useful, Tom.
Shall I get supper?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; he answered. &#8216;Is the galley fire in,
Bates?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Tom,&#8217; said I, &#8216;I&#8217;d like to shift these
petticoats for my <i>Childe Harold</i> dress. You
want seamen; I&#8217;ll make you one.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;ll keep dressed as you are, Marian,&#8217;
said he.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>&#8216;Very well, dear, but don&#8217;t rate me for
being slow.&#8217;</p>

<p>I then went down the steps to the little
caboose. The fire made a light here. I
lighted a lamp, returned to the cabin for
some tea, lighted the lamp there and also
lighted the binnacle lamp for Will, who told
me he was growing confoundedly sick of
steering. I told him I&#8217;d take a spell at the
helm when I had got supper ready. My labours
aboard the convict ship had thoroughly
qualified me, and no old hand as a steward
could have gone to work more adroitly and
with a clearer perception of needs. I brought
a large pot of tea to the table, rearranged the
food that was already there and added to it,
and by eight o&#8217;clock all was ready and the
interior of the deck-house as shining and
comfortable a sea-picture as the eye could
wish to rest on&mdash;quite hospitable and civilised,
with a white cloth, good cutlery, and glass
and crockery equal to the <i>Childe Harold&#8217;s</i>.</p>

<p>Before I was done, however, Tom and
Bates had clewed up the maintopgallant-sail
and furled it. They had also hauled the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
mainsail close up to the yard, and I was in
the cabin when Tom asked me to hold the
wheel that Will might help him furl that big
sail. This they accomplished smartly; they
were three sailors and strong, and after the
rig of the convict ship the brig&#8217;s fabric of
yards and spars seemed no more than a long-boat&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Having got hold of the wheel, I would not
let go till one or all of them had supped. I
was not hungry, and was much refreshed by
my sleep, and I found a sort of pleasure in
grasping the spokes and controlling the meteoric
flight of the little vessel through the
star-clad blowing darkness. I steered her as
easily as I had steered a Thames wherry, and
was proud and thankful to be of so much
importance and use at such a time as this.
And there was another feeling that swelled
my heart whilst I held that wheel. It was
as though Tom were mounted behind me,
and I, with the reins in my hand, was
thundering him to safety away from all risk
and possibility of pursuit, across a boundless
dark plain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>Presently Will, with a pipe in his mouth,
steps out and lays hold of the wheel.</p>

<p>&#8216;You again,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay,&#8217; said he, &#8216;but not for long. Get you
in, old woman. They&#8217;re scheming watches
and want you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Will,&#8217; said I in his ear, &#8216;not another
word against Tristan.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Such a rat-hole to choose!&#8217; said he. &#8216;No
post-office, no bank, no docks, no tea-gardens!
He&#8217;ll let me get home some day, I hope!
But I&#8217;m mum on the matter from this
moment. I don&#8217;t like your looks when you
threaten me. You&#8217;d slit my throat to please
Tom!&#8217;</p>

<p>I boxed his ear and entered the cabin.</p>

<p>I sat down beside Tom, who gave me some
tea, and I made a light supper. He told me
that he and I would keep watch till midnight,
and Bates and Will till four. They would
then relieve us. We did not sit long. Whilst
I ate, our talk was all about Tristan. He
seemed very resolved.</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;ll heave-to off the island,&#8217; said he,
&#8216;and I&#8217;ll go ashore or send for Glass. There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
may be a parson on the island by this time.
I hope so. It won&#8217;t do to go away to the
Cape and get married, Marian. Table Bay is
all too public. The town&#8217;s full of English, and
then this brig&#8217;s consigned there, and they&#8217;ll
want the story of our falling in with her and
how it came about.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;They&#8217;ll print what they hear; they have
newspapers,&#8217; said the mate.</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;ll see what help the islanders can
give us. I&#8217;d sooner head west than east for a
parson, Marian.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;One should go west to get married.
Heading east makes time, and the less time
the better when the job&#8217;s over&mdash;occasionally,&#8217;
said the mate with a dull smile.</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;d return in the brig to Tristan,&#8217;
continued Tom, who seemed not to know
that the mate had made a joke, &#8216;and Bates
and Will would proceed for the Cape with a
yarn of falling in with the <i>Old Stormy</i> that&#8217;ll
utterly sink my name out of the matter.&#8217;</p>

<p>So saying, he went to his berth, and
returned with a seaman&#8217;s jacket and a good,
almost new, shawl for the neck. He wrapped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
me up, saying that I&#8217;d be obliged to stand
sometimes at the wheel, whilst he looked
about him; and that of a night, though a
man be under the Line, yet, if it blows, he&#8217;ll
need plenty of clothes at the helm.</p>

<p>I took the wheel from Will, who went to
a cabin to sleep. Bates lay down in the
berth he had chosen; and Tom&#8217;s and my
watch began. It was then drawing on to
nine o&#8217;clock. There was no moon as yet.
The wind blew somewhat strong off the
quarter, but it came warm. The dew was
very heavy; and every time the brig rolled
the reflection of a large, beautiful star just
past the maintopsail yardarm shot like a
summer flash of lightning along the wet
deck. The brig was under very easy canvas,
though the whole topsail and foresail swept
her along in foam. The sea throbbed black
over the rails, with here and there a little
burst of phosphoric light in some head of
curling yeast.</p>

<p>Sometimes Tom came to the wheel and
held it, and then we talked shoulder to
shoulder for half an hour together. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
I&#8217;d sit in the cabin for rest and shelter,
then steer the brig whilst Tom mounted to
the roof of the deck-house to take a view of
the sea.</p>

<p>About ten I think the moon rose and
shone very yellow; the sea looked vast, dark,
and lonely when the orb floated clear of the
dusky atmosphere over the edge of the ocean,
and cast a sickly flickering wake upon the
black tremble of waters under her. There
was a little clock in the cabin; it had been
set right at noon that day: when it was midnight
by it I roused Will and the mate, and
Tom and I went to sleep in our respective
berths.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XLI<br />


<small>SHE VIEWS THE ISLAND OF TRISTAN D&#8217;ACUNHA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I fell</span> asleep quickly and my slumber was
sweet, for it was one long dream of Tom.
Earnest and full of passion at times had been
our talk whilst we stood together at the
wheel, and the imaginations of my slumber
were richly coloured. At four Will awoke
me, and I rose with the promptitude of a
sailor, and had relieved Mr. Bates at the wheel
before Tom came out of his berth. It was
very dark. My cousin, instead of going immediately
to his bed, went up the steps to the
top of the house; he stayed two or three
minutes, then putting his head over that we
who stood below might hear him, for Tom
had now arrived, he cried out: &#8216;I guess I
was right; now I&#8217;m sure of it. Captain
Butler, there&#8217;s a sail dead in our wake, and
she seems to be overhauling us hand over fist.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>Tom and the mate ran up; presently Will
looked over and called down: &#8216;Marian, starboard&mdash;d&#8217;ye
understand me?&#8217; I answered by
immediately putting the helm over.</p>

<p>&#8216;Steady!&#8217; shouted Tom. I whirled the
little wheel back and kept the brig&#8217;s head
straight at about two points off the course we
had been pursuing.</p>

<p>&#8216;Take the wheel, Johnstone,&#8217; Tom cried,
&#8216;and keep your ears open, my lad.&#8217;</p>

<p>I surrendered the spokes to my cousin and
mounted the steps with eagerness and expectation;
I had caught a note of excitement in
my sweetheart&#8217;s voice. The shift of helm had
brought the wind almost directly over the
stern of the brig; I looked along the white
line of her wake, thinking to see the ship at
the extremity of it, but, beholding nothing, I
asked Mr. Bates where the sail was. He pointed
over the lee quarter, and there to be sure
hung a big dim cloud of canvas.</p>

<p>The moon was low and without power;
the stars had grown wan since midnight, as
though to the approach of dawn or as if to a
gathering of windy thickness; the ship astern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
was visible by a kind of light of her own in
her canvas&mdash;she showed as an iceberg might
by night, or a tall snow-covered hill. I
stood near Tom, the mate joined us, and we
watched the white shadow growing out of the
gloom.</p>

<p>Our change, of course, so postured the
stranger that in a manner of speaking she was
crossing our stern, so that she&#8217;d pass on our
weather quarter close to.</p>

<p>&#8216;I believe it&#8217;s she&mdash;I believe it&#8217;s she!&#8217;
Tom muttered, speaking to himself.</p>

<p>Nothing was said for some time. The
foam broke from under our counter in a trail
of light like the glittering scar left by a meteor
in the sky. We were washing through
it at seven knots, and the great dim cloud of
canvas astern at eleven or twelve. She had
now shaped herself into a clear outline against
the thin stars, and I could see the white water
boiling at her forefoot.</p>

<p>&#8216;Captain Butler,&#8217; exclaimed the mate, in a
voice of agitation, &#8216;that&#8217;s the <i>Childe Harold</i>!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes! She&#8217;s the convict ship,&#8217; said Tom,
catching me by the hand. &#8216;Do you see that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
her main-royal lies furled? Whither away?
Whither away?&#8217; cried he, looking at the
ship.</p>

<p>&#8216;Fore and maintopmast stu&#8217;n&#8217;sails!&#8217; exclaimed
Mr. Bates. His voice quivered, now
he recognised the ship he was first officer of
but a little while gone.</p>

<p>She loomed up upon our quarter in a
thunderous heap of pallid flying shadow, and
the low red western moon and the lean stars
and the throb of black waters, flashful with
foam, ridging southwards, were the fittest
setting the night could have contrived for
her; and that deep spirit of desolation which
in the dark hours of the ocean morning
spreads out of the gloomy distance was present
and abounding. She showed no light,
but the foam which broke in masses from her
bows and fled along her sides swift as smoke
touched the fabric of the noble ship&#8217;s hull
with its own radiance, and we viewed her as
though by moonlight.</p>

<p>She was about a quarter of a mile distant
when she swept past us. All that way off I
heard the drum-like roll of the wind in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
high white spaces of her canvas, and the sullen,
continuous roar of the water she parted.
And all the time she hung to windward,
drawing ahead and opening out the squares
of her sails till their hollows, blackening upon
us, showed like a growing thunderstorm upon
the sea-line, but with never a wink of light
from cabin window or binnacle-stand. Tom
and the mate commented upon her; my
sweetheart in a rapid, fierce voice; Bates
sulkily.</p>

<p>Tom said: &#8216;The devil&#8217;s in command there,
and he has stocked her forecastle with a
troop of devils.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;They&#8217;ll be no worse than their shipmates,&#8217;
said the mate.</p>

<p>&#8216;How they&#8217;re driving her! Our escape
has woke them up! There&#8217;s fear and there&#8217;s
meaning, too, in that press. Where are they
bound to, and who&#8217;s to carry them there?
Are they lying drenched and drugged and
damned again as last night, thick as poisoned
rats one atop of another? Oh, the beasts!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I guess what&#8217;s happened,&#8217; said the mate,
in a gloomy voice. &#8216;That chap with a cast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
eye, who put the scheme of the Pacific Islands
into their heads, has taken charge of the ship.
There&#8217;s a sailor&#8217;s hand in that spread of
cloths. Butler, they&#8217;ll know where they
started, from what you told them; that cast-eyed
rogue&#8217;ll heave the log and plump foul
of what&#8217;s nearest and split. Lord, what a
beautiful ship to run away with! And they&#8217;ll
lose her, they&#8217;ll lose her!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;They&#8217;re steering straight for Tristan
d&#8217;Acunha,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Aye, straight as a fly crawls up a pane
of window!&#8217; exclaimed Tom. &#8216;She&#8217;ll make
no Tristan. They&#8217;ll head off for the Horn,
and continue their navigation with a chart
they can&#8217;t read and a dirty forefinger.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;If Barney Abram but knew we were in
this brig!&#8217; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>Tom left the top of the deck-house and let
go the maintopsail halliards. The big sail
bellied out from the yard on the cap, losing
its driving power, and in a few moments the
brig&#8217;s pace sensibly diminished.</p>

<p>&#8216;Let her get out of sight,&#8217; said he, returning.
&#8216;There&#8217;s no horizon wide enough to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
divide us. Why, Bates, think of daylight
coming along and a stark calm falling, and
yonder ship of devils, with Nick at the helm
and Barney at the prow, lying stagnant within
an easy boat-row!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Here&#8217;s a wind to blow her clear of us,
sir,&#8217; said the mate.</p>

<p>They continued to talk; I, with my eyes
fastened upon the fading shadow, sank into
deep thought. Was that ship out there the
vessel Tom and I and Will had boarded in the
East India Docks? Was she the craft into
whose black-hole under the forecastle I had
crept, when all was silent in her prison &#8217;tweendecks,
while she lay at rest alongside the
<i>Warrior</i> hulk? Was she the theatre of the
tragedy of the convicts&#8217; uprisal, of their nightmare
carousals? Was it yonder shadow fast
blending with the gloom upon the waters,
whose fabric had re-echoed the obscene songs,
the blasphemous jokes, the insane yells of the
self-freed felons?</p>

<p>No more for a time than a wonderful
horrible dream did it all seem to me as I stood
looking&mdash;a frightful vision from which I must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
awaken and find myself in my bed at home,
starting up to grieve and yearn for Tom as of
old, and saying to myself: This dream came
to me by thinking, before I fell asleep, of
what his life would be on board the convict
ship and how I was to make sure of joining
him in the country he was transported to.</p>

<p>The shadow vanished. It was the last we
ever saw of the convict ship. It was the fittest
of all disappearances for her. The folds
of the morning darkness swallowed her up as
though she had been thundered at headlong
speed into the blackness of death&#8217;s dominions,
whose obscurity was thickened yet by the
vapours of the inextinguishable fires.</p>

<p>I started, sighed, and passed my arm
through Tom&#8217;s.</p>

<p>At about eight o&#8217;clock this morning there
was a lull in the wind; it then shifted suddenly
into the south-east, blowing small at first,
but freshening afterwards until it had settled
into the steady pouring of the trade gale. I
held the wheel while the three braced the
yards forward, and soon the little brig was
humming along on what sailors call a taut<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
bowline with her fore and main royals set, and
as fair a prospect of fine weather to windward
as ever the noble commercial breeze of the
South Atlantic painted in clouds and dyes of
clear pure blue.</p>

<p>This same morning, after breakfast, I still
steering the little ship, Tom and the others
overhauled the vessel afresh. They lifted the
main-hatch and took a look below. They
entered the lazarette, searched the fore-peak,
closely again examined the crew&#8217;s sleeping-quarters.
They met with everything essential
in the equipment of a small brig&mdash;suits of
sails, carpenter&#8217;s tools, boatswain&#8217;s stores in
plenty. Indeed, Tom said she was the best
found craft of her sort he had ever seen.</p>

<p>He found a brace of pistols and ammunition
for them in the captain&#8217;s cabin. There
were no other small-arms on board.</p>

<p>When the brig had been trimmed for the
trade-wind, they went to work to chock and
secure the <i>Childe Harold&#8217;s</i> quarter-boat in the
place where the brig&#8217;s long-boat had stood;
afterward, Will mixed a pot of paint and
painted out the name &#8216;<i>Childe Harold</i>, London,&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
in the stern of the boat. Mr. Bates then carefully
gauged the stock of fresh water and found
a handsome supply, sweet and good.</p>

<p>And now, till we made the island of Tristan
d&#8217;Acunha, there befell nothing worthy to
detain you. We found no difficulty in managing
the brig. Larger ships than the <i>Old
Stormy</i> had been handled and safely worked
across the wildest and widest breasts of ocean
in the world by crews at least as small as ours.
My share consisted in cooking, preparing the
cabin table for meals, steering when my watch
came round and when Tom was weary of
standing at the wheel or wished to get upon
the deck-house top to look about.</p>

<p>Both Will and Bates fell very quiet. They
read Tom&#8217;s resolution in his face and they
heard it in his voice, and they came into his
scheme of touching at Tristan as though
they themselves had been escaped convicts
eager to hide.</p>

<p>Many a long talk did I have with Tom
over his project, and I know that I never
breathed a syllable in opposition to his wishes.
Particularly do I recall a conversation we held<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
one night in the first watch; he steered, and
I, who was tired, sat on a chair close beside
him. The trade-wind sang shrill betwixt our
leaning masts; regularly as the beat of a
clock the brig heeled to the slant of the windward
surge and bowed her lee side till the
froth spat and snored along the very line
of her bulwark-rail.</p>

<p>&#8216;No, Tom,&#8217; said I, answering him; &#8216;don&#8217;t
call it banishment. Banishment for me must
be where you are not.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ve tried, for your sake,&#8217; said he, &#8216;to
think of another and a better plan, but Tristan
in my mind for ever stands steadily best and
first. Let Bates and Will believe we mean to
settle there. Our imprisonment shall be just
as short or long as we choose.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We can leave when we please?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Whalers are constantly calling at the
island; they fish in many seas, and they&#8217;ll
give us a wide choice of retreats.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yet I wish Corporal Glass didn&#8217;t know
you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why? By knowing me he&#8217;ll the more
readily believe in my story. What have I to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
dread? Suppose news reaches the island of
the seizure of the <i>Childe Harold</i>, would Glass
and the few simple families of the place
imagine me a convict? Not surely in the
face of the story I must relate, Marian.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;When the news gets home they may send
men-of-war to search for the convict ship.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;My dear, I am a sailor first of all; put it
thus: The <i>Childe Harold</i> will be fallen in with;
no need to search for her in that case. Or
she may founder. Never imagine that of so
great a company every soul will perish; she
has boats, but a single survivor would suffice to
acquaint them at home with her fate. And
how must the yarn run as regards myself?
The convict who took command got away in
a boat. What became of him? Let them
find out.&#8217;</p>

<p>He cried out vehemently after he had said
this, &#8216;Oh, my own, that I should be forced to
hide! But it has come to it. You are with
me and of me, Marian; but what sort of future
lies before you?&#8217;</p>

<p>I arose and kissed him, and, with my arm
about his neck, held my cheek pressed to his.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
He calmed down quickly, and I got him to
talk to me about the island. He told me that
when the British troops landed in 1816, the
only person on Tristan was an Italian. He
was in possession of a large sum of money;
but they never succeeded in finding out who
he was, how he came by the money, or what
had become of his companions. Tom said
that the idea of seeking a refuge in that island
had occurred to him in the time when the
convicts were planning the seizure of the
ship. His long chat with Corporal Glass on
the occasion of his visit a few years before
occurred to him, and he remembered many
things that he had seen and heard, such as
the little group of cottages situated on the
tabled tongue of land, the scanty stock of
domestic furniture and utensils, the abundance
of English farm-produce, bread, bacon, eggs,
butter, milk, poultry, and the like. For groceries
and clothes, he said, the families depended
on a passing emigrant ship or American
whaler. They used no money. Ships were
glad to exchange what the islanders wanted
for potatoes and such fresh provisions as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
island yielded. This is what I can recollect
of what Tom told me of that island.</p>

<p>The days passed quickly; the work of the
brig kept our hands full, and when, of an
evening, I looked back on the hours, I&#8217;d
marvel at the swiftness of their flight. The
south-east trades failed us; we then took a
strong wind out of the west, which drove
us along with the speed of steam. There was
small doubt now of our making the island
within the fortnight, computing from the day
when we fell in with the brig. At long
intervals a sail hove into view, but we never
sighted anything within speaking distance,
nor would Tom have had anything to say to a
ship, though she had come close enough to be
within hail of the voice.</p>

<p>It was Sunday morning. I was aroused
by Will, who beat upon my cabin-door. He
asked me if I was awake. I answered, &#8216;You
may hear me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Then,&#8217; said he, &#8216;step out and take a look
at the island Butler&#8217;s to make you queen of,
for I&#8217;ll be hanged if the heap of cinder isn&#8217;t
right over the bows.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>I clothed myself in a breathless hurry, and,
coming out, found Mr. Bates at the wheel and
Will on the bulwarks, looking ahead, and Tom
on the deck-house roof, pointing the brig&#8217;s
telescope at the sea. The morning was bright
and silent. A light north-easterly wind held
the canvas hushed. Long lines of swell were
flowing out of the south-east. For leagues
northward and eastward the sea was full of
the light of the sun.</p>

<p>I looked directly ahead, and instantly
beheld a large, dim, violet cloud upon the
horizon.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is that Tristan d&#8217;Acunha, Tom?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes!&#8217; he exclaimed, turning quickly.
&#8216;That&#8217;s our island, Marian.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;A noble hiding-place!&#8217; I cried.</p>

<p>Indeed, that point of shadowy land lying
upon the mighty face of the deep was such
a revelation of loneliness that, when you
viewed it and thought of the measureless
leagues of ocean stretching from it west to
the South Pacific, east to the Australian
meridians, you thought that here only in
this prodigious liquid waste was earth&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
deepest, wildest, most awful secret of solitude
to be learned and solved.</p>

<p>Tom&#8217;s eyes were upon me. He brought
his face close and whispered, &#8216;They&#8217;ll never
think of us as being there.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s as lonely as a star.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;ll be getting a better view presently.
I hope there&#8217;s nothing lying off. If there is,
I&#8217;ll push on and heave-to behind the horizon
till I think it&#8217;s gone.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Is there a harbour, Tom?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, no,&#8217; he replied, with a shake of his
head and a faint smile. &#8216;No other harbour
than a two-mile offing. That heap is about
eight thousand feet tall. You see but a little
of it. The mass from midway&#8217;ll be wrapped
up in a cloud. The inshore wind strikes and
rebounds in offshore gales. I&#8217;ll not leave the
brig. They&#8217;ll put off, and if they&#8217;ll lend me
two or three hands to work us, then, after
I&#8217;ve introduced Glass to you, if he&#8217;s well
enough to board us&mdash;and spun my yarn to
him with you as the only listener&#8217;&mdash;and here
he glanced at Will, who still overhung the
rail, looking ahead&mdash;&#8216;we&#8217;ll proceed.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>I did not ask where to; we had talked
the thing over and over again, and the four of
us were agreed that nothing could be settled
till we were off the island and saw how affairs
stood there. It was just possible that a missionary
parson had settled in Tristan since
Tom&#8217;s visit; in that case we could be made
man and wife out of hand and so spared a
new voyage in search of a church. Then,
again, nothing could be decided until we knew
that the islanders would lend us two or three
of themselves to help work the brig.</p>

<p>The wind scanted as the day advanced,
and we were further hindered by a heavy,
long-drawn swell off the port bow. There
was no chance of our reaching the island
before dark within communicating distance.
At sunset the huge mass of towering rock
was about two leagues away, and even then
a most wonderful sublime sight. Bodies of
orange-coloured mist clung to the mountain,
whose snow-crowned peak, piercing the sun-touched
vapour, gleamed in a soft rose in the
delicate evening blue. We saw no vessel
under the island or upon the sea-line. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
lofty land swiftly darkened into the liquid
dusk when the sun sank, and over it, where
it stood invisible, hung the stars of the
Southern Cross.</p>

<p>The cabin barometer promised fair weather;
the brig flapped onward through the darkness,
bowing deeply to the swell; but somewhere
between eight and nine, Tom considering we
should need the offing we then had, the three
backed the yards on the main, and the vessel
was brought to a stand. The lighter sails
were clewed up and furled, and the mainsail
snugged by its gear.</p>

<p>Whilst Tom and the others were aloft
and I was at the wheel, I heard a strange
hissing noise close to. It was like a locomotive
blowing off steam. The rolling of the
brig depressed the bulwarks and gave me
a sight of the sea, and I spied, at the distance
of a pistol-shot, the great black body of a
whale, with a jet of water, bright with phosphorus,
sparkling plume-shaped out of it.
Tom from aloft called down to me to look,
but the monster sank almost immediately, and
if it reappeared I neither heard nor saw it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>This trifling incident somehow wonderfully
accentuated the vastness and solitude
of the ocean to the mood that was then upon
me. I strained my eyes in the direction
where I guessed the island to be and pictured
myself upon it, gazing upon the dark plain of
the deep, sensible that, saving two adjacent
rocks, no land was to be come at for hundreds
and hundreds of leagues. The shadow of the
mighty ocean mountain was upon my spirits,
not in a depressing or a despondent weight,
but with an influence that subdued and awed
me. I thought of that part of London in
which I had dwelt, the streets filled with the
noise of people in motion, the lighted shops,
the ceaseless rattle of wheels, the docks complicated
as a giant cobweb with rigging and
masts pointing in silence into the gloomy
river sky, the flash of lanterns on the water,
the starry lines of lamps on either bankside,
of my house at Stepney; and I beheld my
father and mother again with my mind&#8217;s eye,
and Mr. Stanford&#8217;s strange, sickly child; my
unloved dead sister; I thought of my aunt&#8217;s
cheerful house near the Tower, the pleasant,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
hospitable rooms above the offices, the piano
at which I had sung, the supper-table round
which we had gathered; and then I searched
the dark distance for the shadow whereon
I was to dwell, and said to myself, if there
should be a clergyman there, by this time
to-morrow I may be Tom&#8217;s wife.</p>

<p>I shivered and pressed my head. A sense
of the unreality of my existence came upon
me; it was a sort of madness whilst it lasted.</p>

<p>Tom had descended the rigging and came
to my side, and, unable to control myself, I
threw my arms round his neck and burst into
tears.</p>

<p>He held me to him and called to Will, who
had just sprung from the bulwarks, to take
the helm, and led me into the deck-house and
seated me.</p>

<p>&#8216;What is it, Marian?&#8217;</p>

<p>He eyed me anxiously, his face almost
stern with gloomy apprehension as he asked
the question.</p>

<p>&#8216;We have gone through so much, Tom,
and the end is at hand. Let me cry;&#8217; and
I hid my face and wept again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>He held his peace till I looked at him,
and then said, &#8216;Marian, it&#8217;s not too late.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What is not too late?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Bates and Will will take care that you
reach home safely.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, Tom, it&#8217;s not in your heart. You
don&#8217;t mean it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Marian, my love for you makes me feel
a villain for permitting you to have your way.
Why did you cry?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Because I was afraid.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Afraid! Oh, yes! Such a home even
for a year, even for a month, might terrify
a stouter heart than yours into more than
tears.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I was afraid because I thought to myself,
standing alone just now and recalling the past
and looking into the darkness where the island
lies, all this must be a dream&mdash;I shall awaken
from it and find Tom a prisoner and away
from me, and my heart aching for him.&#8217;</p>

<p>He viewed me with impassioned earnestness;
his face lighted up; he smiled with one
of those looks which brought him before me
in the days of his glowing, manly beauty,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
when I had first met him, when calamity was
still afar and all was well.</p>

<p>&#8216;Dearest!&#8217; he said, and coming to me
he tenderly rested my head upon his shoulder;
and thus we sat with our hearts too full for
speech.</p>

<p>The brig being hove to, the helm needed
but little or no attention. The wheel was
secured, and the vessel lay in the hollow of
the large, wide swell, rolling as regularly
as the breast rises and falls in sleep. It was
decided that the three should divide the
watches, one keeping a look-out at a time
and the others lying near, handy to arouse.
Tom told me to rest throughout the night,
and I obeyed him; but my rest was very
broken, and when I slumbered I dreamed
strangely.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XLII<br />


<small>SHE MEETS THE TRISTAN ISLANDERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> awakened shortly after daybreak by
Tom. He called to me that it was a fine
morning, with a pleasant air of wind, and that
I was wanted at the wheel whilst he and
the others trimmed sail. I passed through
the cabin-door to the wheel, and found the
morning fair and bright indeed, the air delicate
and soft as a tender day in May at home;
the wind was north, blowing directly for the
island, which, when I went on deck, was off
the starboard beam, a giant lump of land,
truly, and more imposing than Teneriffe, as I
have heard sailors say, because of its colour
and loneliness, though the mighty Canary
peak soars to nearly double Tristan&#8217;s altitude.</p>

<p>It stood at a distance of seven or eight
miles. The upper half of the mountain was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
clothed in motionless lines or wreaths of
steam-white cloud, but the snow-clad summit
sparkled in the early sunshine and looked
like the moon, but more brilliant, soaring out
of vapour. The base was of a dark and
sullen hue.</p>

<p>Will loosed the lighter sails, the yards
were squared, and the brig floated slowly
toward the island. I saw no ship, and was
mightily thankful. We got breakfast; and
when that meal was ended, Tom bid me
prepare the table for company; he said some
of the islanders would come aboard when we
hove to again, and must be hospitably welcomed.
I made the best show to be contrived
out of the brig&#8217;s larder, and put some
of the <i>Old Stormy&#8217;s</i> wine on the swing trays.
Whilst this was doing, Tom went into his
cabin and carefully shaved and dressed himself.
They had found clothes belonging to
the murdered master and mate of the brig,
and neither Tom nor Bates had scrupled to
wear them.</p>

<p>When my sweetheart stepped out, he was
more like his old self in appearance than I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
had seen him for many a long day. He wore
blue cloth trousers and waistcoat, and the
round jacket that had come from the <i>Childe
Harold&#8217;s</i> slop-chest; the collar of his sailor
shirt lay open and exposed his finely shaped
throat above the black silk handkerchief
carelessly tied there. He had found and put
on a sealskin cap, which suited him admirably
well.</p>

<p>&#8216;This is a good, hospitable spread,&#8217; said
he, looking at the table. &#8216;This will warm
the cockles of the corporal&#8217;s heart. The poor
fellows are not always dealt with as though
they came off hungry&mdash;at least by French
and Yankee whalers.&#8217;</p>

<p>He took up the brig&#8217;s glass, and I followed
him to the top of the house, wishing
Will good morning with a kiss of my hand
as I passed him at the wheel. Bates, on
top of the house, stood soberly surveying
the island. He said to Tom: &#8216;The yarn&#8217;s
to be left to you, I take it, Butler, and my
part&#8217;s to nod?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s it,&#8217; said Tom.</p>

<p>He pointed the glass and carefully swept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
the island and the sea on either hand of it,
then bade me look. The huge volcanic rock
was now between three and four miles off.
The base was of perpendicular cliffs of lava,
about fifty feet high. Beyond was a level
strip of land, backed by the mountain, which
rose abruptly to about four thousand feet,
then shelved peakwise to its star-searching
height. The swell burst against the iron foot
of the island and boiled in a wool-white line.
Thick heaps of white cloud clung to the
towering eminence, but the summit remained
visible, a delicate white, glittering like a
sugar-loaf in the rich morning blue.</p>

<p>&#8216;D&#8217;ye see the houses, Marian?&#8217; said Tom.
&#8216;Look away to the left, low down.&#8217;</p>

<p>I pointed the telescope, and presently saw
a number of little cottages, situated on the
north extreme of the long level strip of land.
I did not quickly distinguish the buildings.
They were of the colour of the mass of rock,
and mingled with the background.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll suppose I gazed with passionate
interest. There before me, large in the lenses
of the telescope, lay my new home. I wondered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
which of the cottages might fall to Tom
and me&mdash;whether we should have to build for
ourselves. How was life spent upon that
island? How did the slender community
occupy and amuse themselves? Tom had
talked to me of farming, seal-hunting, fishing,
cultivating fruit-trees in the sunny and sleepy
hollows of the several little craters. But surely
the days were peaceful and to be happily
spent; and if that lovely island did but give
Tom the safety and heart-ease I prayed for,
I&#8217;d be willing to pass my whole life upon it,
and share a grave in it with my dear one.</p>

<p>Thus ran my thoughts whilst I looked.
I put the telescope in Tom&#8217;s hand again; he
eyed me inquiringly and anxiously. I answered
his look by saying, &#8216;It is beautiful
and calm and grand; I can imagine no spot
I would choose before it.&#8217;</p>

<p>When we were come within two miles of
the shore, the brig&#8217;s topsail was backed and
her light sails furled; by the time this was
done I, who had secured the helm and gone
to the deck-house top to take another view
of the lava-coloured swelling places, spied a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
white boat making for us; by help of the
glass I counted four men in her. She came
along quickly. We went to the gangway to
receive the boat, and Will stood by with a
line.</p>

<p>Tom, looking through the telescope, exclaimed,
&#8216;The corporal&#8217;s not one of them!
I believe I recollect the stroke oar&mdash;it&#8217;s Peter
Green, a Dutchman.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The corporal may be dead,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;It will not matter,&#8217; he answered.</p>

<p>The white whale-boat swept alongside;
the coil of line flung by Will was caught;
three of the fellows scrambled aboard by way
of the main-chains, and the fourth followed
quickly after thrusting the boat, secured by
the line, clear of the brig. Three of them
were elderly men, and one middle-aged; they
were dressed in large grass hats, blue jackets,
and two of them in trousers of a fearnought.
Tom stepped up to the man that had pulled
stroke, and, giving his hand, said:</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re Peter Green. Do you remember
me?&#8217;</p>

<p>The fellow had an old homely Dutch face,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
withered by the wear of weather, the smallest
eyes I ever saw in a man, lodged deep in
mere gimlet-holes under the grey and white
of his shaggy brows. I was pleased, however,
by his look of simple kindness and good-nature.
He stared with a wrinkled, smiling
face at Tom, and said, &#8216;Yaw, we hov met;
vhas it on dot island?&#8217;</p>

<p>Tom named the date of his visit, the ship,
and was recalling one or two incidents, when
Peter Green again shook hands: &#8216;To be sure!
I remembers you now. And how vhas you,
sir, after all dis time?&#8217; and he cast his little
eyes around the decks as though in search of
the crew. &#8216;Dis vhas your lady, I expect?&#8217;
said he, looking at me and touching his hat.</p>

<p>Tom slightly inclined his head and said:
&#8216;This is Mr. Bates, chief mate, and yonder
young gentleman, Mr. Johnstone, this lady&#8217;s
cousin.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Und dese,&#8217; said Peter Green, waving his
hand toward his three mates, who stood near
him, &#8216;vhas my goodt neighbours and friendts&mdash;Mr.
Alexander Cotton, dot vhas long in
your Royal Navy; Mr. Andrew Hagan, dot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
hails from Boston; and Mr. William Daly, dot
vhas likewise of your navy.&#8217;</p>

<p>Each man, as his name was pronounced,
saluted with a deep sea-bow. I regarded
them earnestly; they were to be neighbours
of mine soon. What was the colour of their
wives, and how many children had they?</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re in time for dinner,&#8217; said Tom.
&#8216;Step into the cabin, will you? Johnstone,
my lad, give an eye to the brig whilst I
entertain our friends here.&#8217;</p>

<p>We entered the deck-house in a body.</p>

<p>&#8216;Bit short-handed, capt&#8217;n, ain&#8217;t ye?&#8217; said
old Cotton, gazing about him with slow
motions of the head.</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;ll come to that soon,&#8217; said Tom.
&#8216;Friends, seat yourselves and fall to. Marian,
there&#8217;s a chair for you next Peter Green.
Bates, I&#8217;ll trouble you to uncork some of that
wine on the swing trays.&#8217;</p>

<p>My presence seemed to embarrass the
poor islanders; they did not speak whilst
their plates were being heaped. They eyed
me shyly and would not eat after they had
been served.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>&#8216;This is good ham&mdash;this is middling beef,
Mr. Green,&#8217; said Tom. &#8216;It&#8217;s the best welcome
our little ship will allow us to give
you.&#8217;</p>

<p>Peter Green bowed his head with the
courteous gesture of a fine old gentleman,
and then, observing that everybody was
served, he stood up and, with a countenance
of great devotion, said grace. The others
hung their heads in a posture of prayer.
Mr. Bates was greatly impressed; Tom and I
exchanged looks&mdash;I saw that he was well
pleased that I should have witnessed so soon
this little illustration of the islanders&#8217; habits.
Grace said, the three old fellows and the others
ate heartily, and conversation then flowed.</p>

<p>&#8216;How is Corporal Glass?&#8217; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&#8216;He vhas not very well to-day,&#8217; answered
Peter Green. &#8216;Dot cancer troubles him.
But I tell him he vhas goodt for many
years.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Please God!&#8217; said William Daly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Anything called off you lately?&#8217; said
Tom.</p>

<p>&#8216;Nothing for five weeks,&#8217; answered Hagan,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
with a nasal accent, &#8216;and she was a French
whaler.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Got a clergyman yet?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Nein,&#8217; answered Peter Green. &#8216;Der
governor wrote by a South-Seaman to der
Bishop of Cape Town. Der vhas no reply
yet.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Parsons ain&#8217;t penguins,&#8217; said Cotton. &#8216;I
tell &#8217;ee, captain, the clergyman as comes to
live amongst us &#8217;ll be a-dedicating of his life to
his Maker, arter a fashion you may overhaul
the lot of your parishes at home afore finding
the like of.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Are there many young children among
you, Mr. Green?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, yaw, considering, marm. Dere
vhas t&#8217;ree generations of us;&#8217; and he named
the number of children.</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t time hang a little heavily with
you?&#8217; said Mr. Bates.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, we gets up early and we turns in
early,&#8217; answered Daly, &#8216;and what&#8217;s between
somehow seems to slide out unbeknown. We
turns a day up as you turns a sandglass up,
and the stuff runs so fast and sly that it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
always seems to be time to go to bed or time
to be getting up.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It vhas eighteen hoondred and twenty-four
dot Corporal Glass vhas governor,&#8217; said
Peter Green. &#8216;Dot vhas joost fourteen years;
und a leetle while ago, when we keep his
birthday, he vhas saying it vhas all der same
as fourteen days, so queek vhas time.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Any of you left lately?&#8217; said Mr. Bates.</p>

<p>&#8216;Two men took on home-sick last year,&#8217;
answered Hagan.</p>

<p>&#8216;How&#8217;s the school getting on?&#8217; inquired
Tom.</p>

<p>&#8216;Foorst class,&#8217; answered Green. &#8216;But I
tell you vhat ve wants. Ve want more young
men. Dere vhas too many fimmen.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Too many of either will eat you up!&#8217;
exclaimed Tom. &#8216;When I was last here,
Glass told me that the island could never
be got to support more than two hundred
people.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Vell, dot vhas right.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Will the corporal be able to come
aboard? I want to see him.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Not to-day, I expect,&#8217; said the grey-haired<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
old man-of-war&#8217;s man named Daly.
&#8216;That there lip of his is a-worriting him.
We&#8217;ll put ye ashore, capt&#8217;n. The governor&#8217;ll
be glad to welcome ye.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;re well off for potatoes,&#8217; said Hagan,
&#8216;and there are a few stones of prime beef at
your sarvice. Goats grow scarce. Water-casks
want filling?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, perhaps. I must see to it,&#8217; said
Tom.</p>

<p>&#8216;Vhat might der be in your holdt to
barter mit?&#8217; asked Peter Green.</p>

<p>&#8216;Much that&#8217;ll prove useful to the island,&#8217;
said Tom; &#8216;and that&#8217;s one of the matters I
wish to see Governor Glass about.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Come ashore with us, capt&#8217;n,&#8217; said the
Dutchman.</p>

<p>&#8216;I can&#8217;t leave the brig,&#8217; answered Tom.
&#8216;We&#8217;re short-handed.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;So! I vash vondering where der crew
vhas.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Gone dead?&#8217; inquired Hagan.</p>

<p>&#8216;No. They took the boat and ran from
the brig in mid-ocean. There were five of
them and a cook. The beauties left a note<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
behind them to let us know what had become
of them, that we shouldn&#8217;t feel uneasy. Mr.
Peter Green, your British merchant seaman
slowly and steadily improves, morally and
intellectually. He has hauled down his
bloody flag and chucked his blunderbuss to
the mermaids, and now ships as a respectable
man under a house flag and is rarely guilty
of worse crimes than swearing away his
captain&#8217;s liberty and life, or slitting a windpipe
in the middle watch and making off in
the ship&#8217;s quarter-boat.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I do not exactly understand you, sir,&#8217;
said Peter Green, who had sat straining his
withered, good-natured Dutch face to catch
Tom&#8217;s meaning, his few black fangs of teeth
slowly masticating the while, as though he
chewed the cud.</p>

<p>&#8216;There ha&#8217;n&#8217;t been no blood shed, I hope?&#8217;
said the old fellow Cotton.</p>

<p>&#8216;The aforemast crew of the brig consisted
of five seamen and a cook,&#8217; said Tom. &#8216;They
said that stuff there,&#8217; and here he pointed to
a piece of salt beef, &#8216;wasn&#8217;t sweet enough for
such choice gums as theirs, so they stole the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
boat and made off&mdash;a new way of running
from a ship, Mr. Cotton, eh?&#8217;&mdash;the old man-of-war&#8217;s
man gravely inclined his wrinkled
face&mdash;&#8216;and left us too short-handed to enable
me to go ashore with you now and visit
Governor Glass. But he&#8217;ll come aboard, I
hope?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Vhere vhas you from, capt&#8217;n?&#8217; inquired
Peter Green.</p>

<p>&#8216;The brig&#8217;s from the Mersey.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How&#8217;s the Mersey a-looking?&#8217; exclaimed
Daly, with an expression of eagerness in his
old eyes.</p>

<p>Peter Green thrust in again.? &#8216;Vhere
vhas you bound?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The cargo&#8217;s consigned to Cape Town.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Dis vhas a leedle out of your road.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, yes. But I&#8217;ve called to see Corporal
Glass.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Dere vhas t&#8217;ree shipwreckt men on der
island,&#8217; said Peter Green, &#8216;dot ve vhas glad
to get rid of, und dot vhas very thankful to
ship mit you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Call &#8217;em two,&#8217; said Hagan; &#8216;the sick
man&#8217;s no use.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>&#8216;Dot vhas a very bad look-out for der ship
und her people!&#8217; exclaimed Peter Green,
whose glass I had filled with wine. &#8216;Tell der
story, Mr. Hagan.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why,&#8217; said Hagan, speaking through his
nose, &#8216;it was like this: I had stepped out of
my cottage just as day was a-breaking to
take a look &#8217;round; away out nor&#8217;-west I see
something black&mdash;just a black speck. Wal,
I borrows the governor&#8217;s glass and makes out
a ship&#8217;s boat, with an oar stepped and something
white flying from the head of it. Three
of our people, Miller, Riley, and Swain, agree
with me to go and have a look at the boat.
So we launches, and what do we find? A
boat with four men in her; one man dead,
another seemingly dying, t&#8217;other two too
weak to sit up. We got &#8217;em ashore, buried
the body, and brought the others to. Him
that seemed dying is a bit better, but he looks
queer, and, to my mind, ain&#8217;t a-going to last.
He hurt himself somewheres insides when the
scramble happened in the fire. The other
two are all right, and all three want to get
away.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>&#8216;Survivors of a fire. I take it?&#8217; said,
Tom.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yaw,&#8217; answered Green.</p>

<p>&#8216;Smart little barque,&#8217; said Hagan; &#8216;burned
to the water&#8217;s edge. The people got away in
two boats. Them that&#8217;s ashore is the skipper
and mate and an able seaman.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Who&#8217;s the sick man?&#8217; said Mr. Bates.</p>

<p>&#8216;Der mate,&#8217; answered Peter Green.</p>

<p>&#8216;How long have they been with you?&#8217; I
asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;T&#8217;ree weeks, marm. Captain,&#8217; exclaimed
the Dutchman, turning to Tom, &#8216;did you
know the leedle ship? She vhas called&mdash;she
vhas called&mdash;ach, my memory!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The <i>Arab Chief</i>,&#8217; said Hagan.</p>

<p>&#8216;The <i>Arab Chief</i>!&#8217; exclaimed Tom, speaking
slowly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Did you know her, sir?&#8217; asked Peter
Green.</p>

<p>&#8216;A fine clipper barque of six hundred
and thirty tons,&#8217; said Tom, speaking deliberately,
with so sudden a change of voice that
the islanders looked hard at him.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s the vessel,&#8217; exclaimed Hagan.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>&#8216;You have her master and his mate on
the island?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Aye,&#8217; replied Green.</p>

<p>&#8216;Bates, hand me that bottle,&#8217; said Tom.
He poured out a quarter of a tumblerful of
rum, mixed a little water with it, and swallowed
the draught. &#8216;Do you know the
names of the master and mate?&#8217; he inquired,
after a pause.</p>

<p>&#8216;Very vell indeed, if dey vhas not pursers&#8217;
names,&#8217; answered Green. &#8216;Von vhas
Captain Samuel Rotch. Der odder vhas
Meester Nodder. Der man vhas John
Collins.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll return in a minute. I must look to
the brig,&#8217; said Tom, and walked out of the
deck-house.</p>

<p>I was thunderstruck. I could not credit
my senses. I looked at Mr. Bates, who looked
at me, and I felt my face as white as the
cloth upon the table. Rotch and Nodder on
that island! The two fiends who had sworn
away Tom&#8217;s liberty, made a felon of him,
ruined, degraded, shipwrecked his life, forcing
him down here to hide his guiltless head in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
the shadow and solitude of the towering
ocean mountain upon whose shore calamity
had cast them&mdash;those two incarnate devils
within reach of an easy boat&#8217;s row, and themselves
willing to ship in the brig and sail
away in her! I thought my heart had
stopped breathing. I could scarcely fetch a
breath.</p>

<p>Peter Green looked hard at me and said:
&#8216;Poor lady, I hope you did not feel ill,
marm?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Take no notice of the lady,&#8217; said Mr.
Bates. &#8216;These attacks are passing, and due
to the heavy rolling. Drink a little wine,&#8217;
said he. He passed me a small glassful. He
then added: &#8216;The fresh air will revive you;
I recommend you to join the captain on
deck.&#8217;</p>

<p>I rose, and so did Peter Green, and offered
me his hand as though to conduct me. I had
now my voice, and, forcing a smile, begged
him to keep his seat, and went slowly to the
door. I found Will standing near the wheel,
which was secured, and said to the lad: &#8216;Go
in and get your dinner and hear the wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
news. But say nothing. Be satisfied to
listen, and answer no questions, lest the villains
ashore get scent of us, and keep themselves
out of Tom&#8217;s power.&#8217;</p>

<p>He gazed at me as though he believed me
mad. I advanced a little way along the deck,
so as to command a view of the top of the
house. Up there stood Tom, grasping the
brass rail, motionless, just as I recollected his
figure once in the convict ship, his eyes rooted
on the island. He was bare-headed. I re-entered
the cabin for his cap, which lay on
the deck beside his chair, and then went up
the ladder. My sweetheart took the cap and
put it on. The motions of his arms and head
were mechanical, as though he had been mesmerised
and moved only when commanded,
but never before had I seen on his face the
expression it now wore. It was a look of
fierce, savage delight; his whole countenance
was dark with a scowl, in which lurked a
faint, terrible smile. But how is my weak
tongue to express the outward aspect of his
mood then? I dared not speak to him till he
had addressed me. He turned his eyes presently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
from the island and said, with a voice
and manner as fierce as his face:</p>

<p>&#8216;What do you think of this? There is
a God and there is a devil, and God always
wins.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Are they your men?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Rotch and Nodder! Rotch and Nodder!
The one the captain, the other mate of the
<i>Arab Chief</i>! My men? What other man&#8217;s
if not mine?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Tom, you look mad. I feel as you do,
but this is a moment for passionless thought.
The islanders will be coming on deck in a
moment or two; they&#8217;ll carry the story of
your sudden strange agitation ashore. Rotch,
if Rotch it be, may ask questions, get your
description, and stop where he is. Do you
mean that to happen?&#8217; cried I; and when I
had said this I felt the blood mount like fire
to my face. I stretched out my hands toward
the island, and in the fit of uncontrollable
wrath that possessed me motioned like a mad
woman, as though I beheld an apparition
which my delirium compelled me to seize and
drag. Again I could hardly breathe; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
though my heart was bursting to counsel him,
I could not utter a word. The sight of me in
this state did him good; I mean it made him
see the folly and uselessness of wild temper
and raging words at such a time.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yours is the passion, not mine,&#8217; said he.
&#8216;I have made up my mind. I know exactly
what to do. I am glad to have you here to
speak to. Words give relief&mdash;a little relief.&#8217;
And, clasping my arm, he led me to the extremity
of the deck-house.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s too swift, startling, wonderful to
bear!&#8217; I cried, squeezing my brows to ease
the vile ache of throbbing there. &#8216;What do
you mean to do?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Bring them into this brig and keep
them in her till they confess, though I should
have to sail about the world with them till
the vessel goes to pieces,&#8217; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;Then you won&#8217;t settle upon that island?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Not now&mdash;not yet awhile, not until I
have received Messieurs Rotch and Nodder
on board and dealt with them.&#8217; He added:
&#8216;I want time to think. My brain&#8217;s in a whirl.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
If Rotch hears that I&#8217;m the man who has
charge of this brig, he&#8217;ll not come.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Peter Green knows your name.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I believe not. He has not called me by
my name. Did he ask it below?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Not in my hearing.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Butler is no uncommon name, and I&#8217;m
changed&mdash;too changed to be recognised by
the scoundrel in any description of me Peter
Green is capable of.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But Corporal Glass may recollect you,
Tom, and name the ship you arrived off the
island in.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That won&#8217;t help Rotch. He wouldn&#8217;t
identify me as his man by hearing the name
of a ship he&#8217;s not likely to have heard I sailed
in.&#8217; He looked at the island, and cried: &#8216;My
scheme is wholly changed. But I have not
yet formed a resolution. We&#8217;ll talk it over
when the islanders are gone. Bates shall
counsel me as well as you. Let me but get
hold of them here, and by my heavenly
Maker, Marian, they shall swing if they don&#8217;t
sign a confession of my innocence.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Tom, be calm now, dear. The islanders<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
are leaving the cabin. Keep your feelings
under. They stared at you at table. Here
now may be God&#8217;s own gift of a chance to
establish your innocence. Don&#8217;t risk it, don&#8217;t
spoil it, by want of self-control.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;See to yourself,&#8217; said he, almost smiling.
And as he spoke these words the head of
Peter Green showed above the top of the
ladder. The four islanders, accompanied by
Mr. Bates, came on to the deck-house roof.</p>

<p>&#8216;Vell, und how vhas you now, marm?&#8217;
said the Dutchman.</p>

<p>I answered that the fresh air had made
me feel well again.</p>

<p>&#8216;Und you, captain? Vhat vhas your
hurry? Vhas you afraid of der vetter? Der
vetter vhas all right.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Had any rollers here lately, Mr. Green?&#8217;
said Tom, in his ordinary voice.</p>

<p>&#8216;I think dere vhas no rollers,&#8217; answered
the Dutchman, &#8216;since six weeks.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re in for a spell of quiet weather,
captain,&#8217; said old Cotton. &#8216;We&#8217;re obliged to
you for a first-rate blow-out. Dunno how
it is; there&#8217;s a sweetness in wittles at sea<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
which my old teeth never can find in grub
ashore.&#8217;</p>

<p>Hagan, who had stepped to the end of the
deck-house to see if the whale-boat rode safely,
now joined us and exclaimed: &#8216;If you&#8217;d care
to go ashore, capt&#8217;n, I&#8217;ll remain in the brig in
your place.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, I won&#8217;t go ashore; it isn&#8217;t as though
I hadn&#8217;t visited your island. Perhaps you&#8217;ll
bring Glass off to-morrow.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Vhat vhas your name again, captain?&#8217;
said Green. &#8216;Dot I may tell der governor
vhen he asks who vhas his old friend in der
brig.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t you tell him,&#8217; exclaimed Tom, with
a loud, forced, unnatural laugh. &#8216;There is
sometimes pleasure to be got out of surprise,
Mr. Green. Besides, curiosity may coax him
into paying me a visit; name me, and the
corporal will say, &#8220;Oh yes, I remember,&#8221; and
stop ashore. I propose this,&#8217; he continued,
speaking rapidly as though to overwhelm immediate
thought in his hearers by crowding
new ideas upon them. &#8216;First, what can you
let us have?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>Old Daly answered that they could supply
the brig with a small quantity of fresh
beef, plenty of potatoes, a little fruit, eggs,
poultry, and goats&#8217; flesh.</p>

<p>&#8216;We shall want to fill our water-casks.
Will the islanders do that for us if we send
that boat?&#8217; said Tom, pointing to the <i>Childe
Harold&#8217;s</i> quarter-boat chocked in room of the
brig&#8217;s long-boat.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh yes; that shall be done,&#8217; said old
Cotton.</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;ll take all you can let us have,&#8217; continued
Tom. &#8216;And, by way of exchange&mdash;Mr.
Bates, be good enough to carry our
friends into the hold and break out some
cases of wearing apparel. They shall value
the stuff for themselves.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;At once, sir?&#8217; said Mr. Bates.</p>

<p>&#8216;At once,&#8217; responded Tom, stepping to
the skylight to look at the time. &#8216;It&#8217;s a
quarter to three. I shall want a wider offing
for the night, and don&#8217;t want to tow that boat
out to sea.&#8217;</p>

<p>The mate and the islanders went away in
a body. Tom began to pace the deck, often<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
gazing at the island, his brows knitted, his
face very fierce and dark. I guessed by his
looks he wished to be alone, and quietly
descended the ladder, at the foot of which
stood Will smoking a pipe.</p>

<p>&#8216;Marian,&#8217; he cried, &#8216;this is an amazing
thing to happen!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Aye, but you mustn&#8217;t look amazed.
We mean to get the wretches in our power.
Sooner than come aboard they&#8217;d climb to the
top of that island to escape Tom if they suspected
who we were.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What does Butler mean to do?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I can&#8217;t tell you, because he doesn&#8217;t himself
know.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Bringing those fellows aboard doesn&#8217;t
look like your settling on the island, does
it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Tom won&#8217;t settle on that island now, not
if two of the castaways there are Rotch and
Nodder and we can tempt them into the
brig.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And a precious good job for you!&#8217; exclaimed
the lad, with his eyes fixed on the
island. &#8216;Look at it! Imagine living out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
your life there! You&#8217;ve dined with specimens
of its male society. What are its ladies
like? The worth of Butler&#8217;s love for you has
sunk hideously in my esteem ever since he
planned such a rat-hole as that for you to
live on merely because he&#8217;s got to hide his
head.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Hold your tongue!&#8217; I cried. &#8216;Your
esteem! What sort of tape do boys like you
measure the love of such a man as Tom
with?&#8217;</p>

<p>The dear fellow puffed at his pipe with a
little temper, but, controlling himself, said:
&#8216;When the rogues come off they&#8217;ll see Butler
and shout to be set ashore again.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We are not fools,&#8217; said I; and my head
beginning to ache again, and this sort of talk
being profitless, I went into the deck-house
cabin and sat down.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XLIII<br />


<small>SHE SEES CAPTAIN ROTCH AND MR. NODDER
AGAIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Bates</span> and the others were a long time in
the hold; they found trouble in getting at
the goods they wanted. I cleared the table
and tidied the cabin, hot with thought all the
time I worked. If Rotch and Nodder were
truly on the island and we got them into the
brig, how would this amazing venture end?</p>

<p>Meanwhile I held off from Tom; I heard
him walking overhead; the scheme he himself
lighted on was sure to prove the best, and
I guessed when he wanted me he would seek
me.</p>

<p>At last Bates and the islanders came out
of the hold. Tom descended the steps to
talk with them, and I walked out to hear
what passed.</p>

<p>&#8216;Captain,&#8217; said Peter Green, &#8216;ve vhas very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
glad to exchange mit a leedle of what ve hov
seen. Dere vhas some goodt useful shirts,
und ve find der boots und flannel joost vhat
ve&#8217;ll be thankful for in a month or two.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Very well,&#8217; said Tom, who now had himself
wholly under control. &#8216;The arrangements
will stand thus, Mr. Green: I&#8217;ll take a
three-mile offing and heave-to till daybreak.
You&#8217;ll then come off in your whale-boat with
all you&#8217;re able to load, and bring some hands
to carry our boat ashore for fresh water. Is
the hose still connected with the cascade?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay, sir,&#8217; said old Daly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Boats water lying outside the surf?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Dat vhas so,&#8217; said Peter Green.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, when you&#8217;ve victualled and watered
us, you&#8217;ll bring off the three men who want
to get away.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Vhere vhas you bound to again, captain?&#8217;
said Peter Green. &#8216;Ach, my memory!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;To Cape Town,&#8217; answered Tom, quick in
his answer as the report after the flash. &#8216;Will
that suit them?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Dey vhas very grateful. Und so vhas ve.
Der language of dot Captain Rotch does not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
always please Governor Glass. He vhas impatient,
und vhas not enough thankful to
Gott for his life. But, den, poor doyfil, he
has a wife und shilds at home, und den again
he has lost his ship, mit a goodt deal of
property for a hard-verking seafaring man.&#8217;</p>

<p>After a little more conversation to this
effect the islanders got their boat alongside,
shook hands with us all, and went away. It
was hard upon five o&#8217;clock. All day long a
light breeze had been blowing. Now and
again the water crisped friskily close off the
island, as though to a down-rush of cold
breeze from the giant mountain slopes; but
the spread of air was local, and no break
of it came within a mile of the brig. The
sky was pure, cloudless blue&mdash;the rich sky of
the Antipodean summer; and the ocean, flowing
stately in majestic folds of swell, was at
this hour of a most lovely violet colour. The
beautiful tint of sea and sky was in the atmosphere,
and tinged the lofty mass of mountain
to its snow-line. The vapour of the morning
had dissolved upon that eminence. It now
stood in naked, lovely grandeur. The westering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
sunshine flung a faint, delicate dye of rose
upon the snow on its top, and the same fair
tint lived in the line of foam that boiled the
length of the whole base of the bit of solitary
land. The white whale-boat making for the
island showed like a melting snowflake, as she
rose and sank upon the blue heave.</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;ll head out three miles, Bates,&#8217; said
Tom, &#8216;and then sit down and talk.&#8217;</p>

<p>The maintopsail was swung, and the brig&#8217;s
jibbooms slowly rounded into the north. I
went to the galley to see to the fire and boil
water for tea. There was nothing in sight&mdash;no
feather-tip of remote ship&#8217;s canvas&mdash;nothing
but that mountain of Tristan d&#8217;Acunha,
now darkening low down, then strangely
glowing out in snow with gleams here and
there as of waterfalls.</p>

<p>The helm was secured. The brig was
under topsails and foresail only; small need
for a constant look-out on such a bright,
calm, sweet evening as this. We seated ourselves
at the table, but neither Bates nor
Will nor myself broke the silence till Tom
spoke.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>&#8216;Some wonderful things have happened,&#8217;
said he, &#8216;since the convicts seized the ship,
but nothing so wonderful as those men being
on the island I meant to hide myself in.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s God&#8217;s doing,&#8217; said the mate.</p>

<p>Tom inclined his head.</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s no doubt of their being the right
men, d&#8217;ye think, sir?&#8217; exclaimed Will.</p>

<p>&#8216;The <i>Arab Chief</i>, my lad, and then Rotch
and Nodder! Oh, no doubt, Johnstone.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;ll not take it amiss, Butler,&#8217; said the
mate, &#8216;if I ask what notions you&#8217;ve formed&mdash;what
resolutions may have come into your
head?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;First, as to receiving them on board,&#8217;
said Tom, speaking quietly and leisurely,
though there was a look in his face which put
an accent and meaning into his words that
the ear with the eyes closed would not have
caught. &#8216;I must be out of sight. Glass may
come off. I&#8217;ll lie up in my cabin, and sham
indisposition. Should Glass come, I&#8217;ll talk to
him in my berth. You&#8217;ll receive the men and
attend to all that needs looking after until
the islanders go and sail&#8217;s trimmed. I&#8217;ll then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
show myself.&#8217; He looked at me as he said
this, and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8216;I quite understand,&#8217; said Mr. Bates. &#8216;You
can leave everything to me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Bates, I would trust you with my life.&#8217;
He paused, with his eyes fixed upon the mate.
&#8216;Afterward, you&#8217;re thinking?&#8217; he continued.
&#8216;Well, that may be as it shall turn out; but
I&#8217;ve sworn this by my heart, by that lady
there, and by my Maker, that, having them,
I&#8217;ll not let go of them, Bates, till they&#8217;ve
signed a declaration of my innocence and their
own villainy, witnessed by all hands; that,
having them,&#8217; he repeated, with the blood
mounting into his face and his eyes glowing
as though he were in a high fever, &#8216;I&#8217;ll
keep them on the high seas to give them time
to sign; failing which I&#8217;ll hang them at the
yardarms of this brig, though it should come
to my going to the South Sea to find savages
for their executioners.&#8217;</p>

<p>The fire, the passion, the intensity with
which he spoke these words made his delivery
tragically startling and impressive. Bates&#8217;s
countenance fell; Will was pale and alarmed;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
my own spirit was in hot sympathy with
Tom&#8217;s&mdash;I felt all his rage, and his resolution
to give the two devils the alternative of confessing
the truth or of being hanged worked
in me like a strong and flaming drink, and
ran my blood in fire to my very finger-ends.</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re never in earnest, Butler?&#8217; said
the mate in a low voice.</p>

<p>Tom scowled at him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, man, consider; put your respectability
on one side and reflect. Those two fellows
swore me into jail, into the hulk, into the
convict ship, into long months of association
with felons, whose crimes&mdash;many of them&mdash;barely
stopped short of murder. It is to
their training of me they&#8217;ll owe their hanging,
if it comes to it. They&#8217;ve made a devil of
me. They shall find me a devil.&#8217;</p>

<p>Mr. Bates glanced at me somewhat nervously
and said: &#8216;Well, Butler, first let&#8217;s get
them: then we shall be sure they&#8217;re the men,
and when we&#8217;ve got them we must hope
they&#8217;ll confess.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;They&#8217;ll not go out of this ship alive
unless they confess,&#8217; said Tom.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>&#8216;If they confess under terror will their
confession help you, sir?&#8217; said Will.</p>

<p>&#8216;Johnstone is the son of a lawyer, Bates,&#8217;
said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8216;But there&#8217;s good sense in the question,
Butler,&#8217; said the mate. &#8216;They may swear their
confession was a lie, that they were forced
into telling it by your threats to hang them.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The terms of the confession shall provide
against that, and every man in this ship
shall witness it. Let them confess; I&#8217;ll take
my chance of what may follow.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Will Rotch and the other be free here,
Tom?&#8217; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;No.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Then we remain short-handed as before?&#8217;
said Will.</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s a seaman along with the two&mdash;you&#8217;ve
forgotten him,&#8217; exclaimed Tom. &#8216;He&#8217;ll
make four, and Marian five.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Where do you propose to head when
you start?&#8217; exclaimed the mate.</p>

<p>&#8216;North, Bates; I can&#8217;t keep you and
young Johnstone at sea. Not likely! You&#8217;ll
help me to work the brig as far as Soundings;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
then go ashore in whatever will take
you, along with the yarn that we&#8217;ll manufacture
before that time.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;ll you do?&#8217; said the mate.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, keep the sea&mdash;keep the sea until
Rotch and Nodder confess. Eh, Marian?
This brig&#8217;s a tight little home for us, as safe
a retreat in its way as the island, helping us
to such an issue of truth or justice or retribution
as we should never be able to work
out in Glass&#8217;s settlement. Eh, my brave
girl? As lief be here as on a rock; and then
the delights of a devil&#8217;s cruise with our two
Old Bailey witnesses under hatches! Why
&#8217;twould be like one of our old river and suburban
jaunts&mdash;so pretty and lively that we may
grieve when the rogues&#8217; confession ends it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;ll take Miss Johnstone ashore with
us,&#8217; said Bates, &#8216;when the time comes for us
to go.&#8217;</p>

<p>I looked at him with a frown; Tom&#8217;s eye
was upon me, and he laughed, but with little
merriment.</p>

<p>&#8216;You and Marian&#8217;ll never handle this
brig alone,&#8217; said Will.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>Tom was looking at me, and pretended
not to hear him. Bates left the table to see
that all was right with the little vessel. By
the time he returned Tom&#8217;s mood had
changed. He spoke quietly, and without the
least temper, of the morrow&#8217;s arrangements.
It was dark by the time the talk had ended.
I lighted the cabin lamp, Will the binnacle
lamp, and Tom and Bates walked the roof of
the deck-house in earnest talk. Will beckoned
me out of the cabin to where he was standing,
near the wheel, and said softly: &#8216;Marian, beware
of Tom; he&#8217;s been driven mad.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No more mad than you are,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;What does he mean by talking of swinging
the two men?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll help him if he asks me,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;And be hanged. This is what comes of
following a convict&#8217;s fortune. He speaks of
himself as a devil. He talks like one, anyhow.
Worst of all, he&#8217;s making you one.
There shall be no hanging if I&#8217;m here to stop
it, though Butler should pistol me for interfering.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re excited, and I&#8217;ll not talk with you.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>&#8216;Mustn&#8217;t he be mad,&#8217; he exclaimed, careful,
however, to keep his voice sunk, &#8216;to
threaten to sail about with you alone in this
brig till the fellows under hatches, as he calls
it, confess? Suppose they make up their
minds to see which will tire first? Besides,
how are two of you to sail a brig of this bulk?
Why, his island scheme was beautiful sanity
alongside this last bit of roaring madness.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll ask you to mind your own business,&#8217;
I cried. &#8216;Have you a heart? Have you any
capacity of feeling? Did those two fellows
spare Tom? Look what they&#8217;ve brought him
to. And shall we not right ourselves in our
own fashion if the chance offers? Wear irons
as Tom has, sweat in forced labour in a convict&#8217;s
dress, be ruined, degraded, broken-hearted,
yet innocent as Tom is, and imagine
the villains who falsely swore you into ruin,
misery, exile, in your power. Would you
damp their pale brows with lavender water,
wash their weary feet, offer them your forgiveness
with caresses, promise to plead for
them in your prayers? Chaw! You&#8217;re no
man, Will!&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>I swung on my heels in a passion, and left
him.</p>

<p>That evening, until ten or thereabouts, we
sat in the cabin. I believed Tom guessed
what was in Will&#8217;s mind. The lad had a
bright, handsome face. A little thing would
bring his heart into his eyes, and all that he
felt he looked, with colour, with paleness,
with wild stares (as when he came to me after
seeing Lieutenant Chimmo murdered), with a
fine light of merriment when he was amused.
For the first time I could recollect, my sweetheart
went carefully, and with scarce any
temper, through the story of Rotch&#8217;s accusation.
He related how he had punished the
man for rudeness to a young lady at a South
American fandango; how he had reported
him and lost him his berth for sleeping whilst
on duty, and for other reasons. He exactly
described how the treacherous, shocking conspiracy
against him had been worked out and
executed by Rotch, with the help of Nodder;
how the holes had been pierced by Rotch, the
auger hidden in his (Tom&#8217;s) cabin, the lazarette
entered by Rotch when there was no sort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
of stores in it at that time to warrant the
visit. He said he never understood why
Nodder conspired against him. He supposed
Rotch had tempted the beast with drink, with
an offer of money, and the promise of a mate&#8217;s
place in the barque, if he (Rotch) got command.
With his eyes fixed upon Will, he
drew a few pictures of his sufferings in jail,
and of his life in the hulk.</p>

<p>Bates listened closely; the worthy fellow
was stirred to the heart by Tom&#8217;s simple recital
of his wrongs and sufferings. Will&#8217;s face
flushed with sympathy and temper as he listened;
I see his looks now as he leaned on
the table under the cabin lamp, with his eyes
moistening at intervals. As for me, I sat
quiet till Tom had done, though I was half
distracted by the passion and grief, the wrath
and wild regrets which arose as my sweetheart
proceeded, until, on his ending with a
sob in his voice and his hands to his brow, I
could bear myself no longer, and, springing
up, I flung my arms around him and held
him to me with my lips pressed to his cheek,
down which my own tears ran.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>&#8216;Curse them!&#8217; cried Will, starting up;
&#8216;they shan&#8217;t live for the want of a hangman,
if they don&#8217;t confess!&#8217;</p>

<p>He made the sentence violent by a strong
forecastle oath, and, striking the table with
his clenched fist, walked out of the cabin,
talking loudly to himself out of his overwrought
feelings.</p>

<p>The rest of the night passed quietly. Tom
bade me go to bed, and I went to my berth,
but not before I had paced the deck for a
quarter of an hour with him. The weather
was wonderfully silent, and the darkness
beautiful with stars. The light wind held;
the four of us prayed it would hold till after
daybreak, though Tom said the islanders at
this time of the year made nothing of putting
out to sea to vessels six or even eight miles
distant. The large black swell rolled soundlessly;
off the ocean no noise came save the
low, faint thunder of the surf whitening afar
at the base of the giant shadow. I slept but
little; all the most tragic and startling incidents
of this passage of my life, from the hour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
when news of Tom&#8217;s imprisonment was given
to me at Ramsgate by my aunt, were as
naught&mdash;were as trifles lighter than thinnest
air&mdash;alongside this, our lighting upon Rotch
and Nodder in yonder island, hidden away
in the heart of earth&#8217;s mightiest stretch of
waters.</p>

<p>The instant I heard a movement on deck
I sprang out of my bunk, apparelled myself
for the day, and, going forth, found a streak
of granite-coloured dawn in the east, the
night still black and full of stars over our
mast-heads and in the west, and Tom and the
others squaring the yards to a light northerly
wind that would directly float us toward the
island.</p>

<p>The sun rose; the day flashed out blue
and cloudless to his beam. Will took the
helm, and the island soared directly over our
bow, rich with the morning dyes, to where it
vanished in motionless masses of steam-white
vapour. I lighted the galley fire and got
breakfast. Having hove the brig to within a
mile and a half of the settlement, we made a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
meal on deck, Tom every few minutes levelling
the telescope at the beach where the
whale-boat lay.</p>

<p>At about eight o&#8217;clock the island boat put
off. She came slowly, floating deep, and
looked pretty full of men. When she was
midway, Tom, after talking quietly and
earnestly with Bates, withdrew to his cabin
to feign sickness, as had been arranged. On
the boat drawing alongside, I observed that
all the people were strangers, saving old
Daly. There were eight men, some of them
young. Daly made the ninth. I had
supposed whilst the boat approached that
Rotch and Nodder were amongst the little
crowd in her, but no faces answered to theirs,
which I recollected as clearly&mdash;the handsome
features of Rotch, the red locks and wall-eye
of the curled, sour, drink-sodden carpenter
Nodder&mdash;as though I beheld their likenesses.</p>

<p>The boat was handsomely laden with
potatoes, pieces of fresh beef, poultry, eggs,
and other produce. Daly came over the side
with a little bright tin can in his hand. He
immediately stepped up to me, and with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
quaint old sea-bow and a sea-flourish, said he
had taken the liberty to bring me off a drink of
milk; &#8217;twas fresh from one of his own cows
that morning, he assured me. There was no
sweeter draught, said he, than a can of new
milk after a few months of salt water. I
thanked him heartily. Of all delicious
draughts, the delicatest that I remember in
seventy-seven years was that drink of new
milk from the island of Tristan d&#8217;Acunha.</p>

<p>Daly told Mr. Bates that Corporal Glass
was still too unwell to come off; he sent his
compliments to the captain, and begged a
visit. Bates answered that the captain was
poorly and confined to his bed. Then Daly
brought the islanders up to us and introduced
them; two of them were sons of the corporal,
others sons of Cotton, Swain, and Green.
Daly&#8217;s own son was a man of about thirty,
strong, active, and good-looking, tinctured
with the blood of a mulatto mother. They
swiftly discharged their whale-boat, got the
<i>Childe Harold&#8217;s</i> quarter-boat, stowed casks for
filling with fresh water, and pulled away for
the island.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>I went to Tom and gave him the news.
He came out of his berth on hearing the
islanders were gone, and walked about the
deck, and looked at the stuff that had been
brought off; then went with Bates and Will
into the hold, where they passed up one to
another a number of parcels of clothing till
as much was on deck as the provisions which
had been brought off were worth.</p>

<p>It was past one o&#8217;clock when the boats put
off for the brig. The whale-boat came along
with ours in tow. It was blowing a soft
steady air of wind out of the north; the sky
was cloudless; the rippling of water made
you think of a gentle noise of girlish laughter,
and the heave of the swell shouldered in
stately volumes out of the west, wide drawn
and round-backed, so that the movements of
the brig were like a pulse. Tom rested the
telescope on the bulwark-rail and looked at
the approaching boats. He continued to
gaze; I feared the boats would draw near
enough to enable the people to see him. He
suddenly turned to me with a pale face that
was yet dark with a frown, and exclaimed:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
&#8216;Marian, Rotch and Nodder are there!&#8217;
With that he gave the telescope to Bates, and
merely adding, &#8216;Report when the islanders
are gone and you&#8217;ve trimmed for the start,&#8217;
he walked to his berth.</p>

<p>My heart now began to beat wildly, and I
felt faint and sick with excitement. Will and
Bates looked at me. I said: &#8216;I&#8217;ll withdraw
to the end of the deck-house. Does not my
face tell a story?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You look like a ghost,&#8217; exclaimed Will,
&#8216;and your eyes are like live coals! Go right
away aft, and keep quiet, and take time to
screw your fiddlestrings of nerves into tune.
Mr. Bates and I&#8217;ll manage better without
you.&#8217;</p>

<p>I mounted to the roof of the house and
posted myself at the extreme end. There
was a chair there. I placed it so that I could
command a view of the gangway, and there I
sat, still very sick and faint, detesting myself
for this weakness, yet excusing myself, too,
for surely never could there happen a moment
in a woman&#8217;s life more charged with supreme
tragic interest than this.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>The two boats drew alongside, the quarter-boat
laden with casks of fresh water. The
first to step on deck was Rotch. I knew him
instantly. His face, whilst he stood in the
witness-box, giving evidence against Tom, had
burnt itself into my memory. I should have
been able then, as I should be able now, to pick
him out in a moment from amongst a thousand.
He sprang into the main-chains and got over
the bulwarks actively. He was dressed in
blue cloth and a blue cloth cap with a naval
peak. His face was sallow, as though he was
newly recovered from an illness. He was of
Tom&#8217;s height, without my sweetheart&#8217;s manly
breadth and inimitable sailorly carriage. But
he was an exceedingly handsome man. Many
might have thought him handsomer than
Tom.</p>

<p>After he had come on board there was
some delay. Two or three vigorous islanders
then climbed over the side, and, with much
trouble and no little peril&mdash;for the swell hove
the boat very high and sank her very low,
whilst the brig leaned heavily away and then
depressed her other rail till you thought she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
had submerged the line of it&mdash;the carpenter
Nodder was lifted through the gangway. He
stood with difficulty and leaned upon an
islander&#8217;s arm. He was at some little distance
from me, but my sight was good; he seemed
ghastly ill, the ghastlier because of the length
of his greasy, carroty locks of hair and the
villainous aspect he took from his deformed
eye. He was dressed in old canvas trousers,
an old monkey-jacket, and a fur cap.</p>

<p>I had lost sight of Rotch. Bates spoke to
Nodder. Whilst this was doing, a third fellow
came on board; he was John Collins, the seaman
who had been saved with Rotch and the
carpenter. He took hold of Nodder and led
him slowly forward and helped him into the
forecastle through the scuttle.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll now tell you what happened as straight-forwardly
and briefly as I can dictate it. The
islanders went to work to get the water on
board and stow the casks. They sprang like
goats, so fleet were their sure feet, as mountaineers.
Collins came out of the forecastle
and helped them. I walked toward the fore
part of the deck-house to observe that man;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
he was just a plain, average example of the
foremast-hand, freckled, yellow-haired, a mat
of reddish beard upon his throat, big, silly,
wandering eyes; his clothes, duck breeches,
flannel shirt, and old Scotch cap. I drew back,
hearing the voice of Rotch, and returned to
my chair.</p>

<p>Presently they had whipped all the water
below and were busy in hoisting the quarter-boat
aboard. Whilst this was doing, Rotch
came up the deck-house steps; he looked at
the island whilst he mounted the ladder, and
did not observe me till he was on the roof of
the house. He came to a stand very abruptly,
and, after staring with many tokens of astonishment
in his posture and looks, lifted his
cap. I turned my head. No doubt he was
surprised to find a well-dressed woman sitting
on the deck-house top of that little brig of
two hundred tons.</p>

<p>Well dressed I was, as dress then went;
to be sure, I had worn my gown every day
during the fortnight we had been on board
the <i>Old Stormy</i>, but then it was almost a new
dress when I took it off and packed it up at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
Woolwich, and it still looked new. I remember
that gown very well; it was of black
merino with a velvet cape, long sleeves for
which I had no wristbands, the bodice with
an embroidered collar and bound to the waist
by a band. My hat was narrow-brimmed
with curled feathers; this sort of headgear
had not long been in fashion when I purchased
the thing. I was without jewelry and other
finishing details, but the fellow Rotch, at a
little distance, would detect no omissions; he
found a well-dressed, nay, I may almost call
the figure a fashionably-dressed woman viewing
the proceedings of the islanders, and his
bearing and prolonged stare expressed his
surprise.</p>

<p>I was unable to look at him; that is,
whilst he looked at me. The devil that was
in Tom was in me too. I could have shot the
horrid villain as he stood there. But now, in
the corners of my eyes, I beheld him approaching.
I trembled violently; the throbbing
of my heart made me feel ill again. Yet
I thought to myself, if the man accosts me I
must answer and be civil. Times are when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
the human instincts are preternatural in divination.
The contagion of our secret may have
been in the air. Such must be that villain&#8217;s
conscience that, let him suspect a trap, no
matter how dim and faint his suspicion, he&#8217;d
fling himself into the whale-boat while she
was still alongside, and Tom would lose him.</p>

<p>Rightly or wrongly, thus I thought, in the
few seconds of his approach; and now he
stood close and was addressing me.</p>

<p>&#8216;May I inquire,&#8217; said he, lifting his cap
again, &#8216;if I have the pleasure of speaking to
the wife of the captain of this brig?&#8217;</p>

<p>I knew that my face was of a milky whiteness,
my mouth was dry, my breathing
laboured. I answered low and tremulously,
&#8216;I am not the wife of the captain.&#8217;</p>

<p>Do not believe that I was afraid. I was
sick and cold and shivered with the passion I
hid. I dared not lift my eyes, lest beholding
the dog with his smile and bland looks I should
leap to my feet, spit in his face, strike and
curse him.</p>

<p>&#8216;You are, perhaps, a passenger, madam?&#8217;
said he.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>I slightly inclined my head, keeping my
eyes fastened upon the island.</p>

<p>&#8216;I understand,&#8217; he continued, &#8216;that this
brig&#8217;s destination is Table Bay. It is very
fortunate for me that you have called here.
Ships&#8217; visits grow scarcer and scarcer, and a
man might easily be imprisoned for a whole
twelvemonth in yonder wretched but hospitable
little colony.&#8217;</p>

<p>At this instant Will came up the ladder
and stood at the head of the steps, astounded
to observe me talking with Rotch.</p>

<p>&#8216;My misfortunes have been overwhelming!&#8217;
exclaimed the villain, speaking in a tone
that let me know he preserved his courtesy-smile,
though I never turned my eyes from
the island save when I glanced at Will. &#8216;My
beautiful ship, the <i>Arab Chief</i>, a vessel I was
as proud of as a man of his handsome wife,
was burned to the water&#8217;s edge through two
or three scoundrel seamen broaching the cargo
with a naked light. Our sufferings in the
boat were terrible. We put off with barely a
day&#8217;s allowance of fresh water and a handful
or two of biscuits. The islanders may have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
told you in what state they found us. My
mate Nodder is very ill. He injured himself
somehow when leaving the ship. I hope your
captain will not be disappointed. He probably
counts upon the help of three working
men. I shall be very happy to do my share.
I am sorry to hear that he is not well. Pray,
madam, what is his name? The islanders
who were off yesterday did not get it.&#8217;</p>

<p>I rose, saying, under my breath, &#8216;Excuse
me. I want to speak to that young gentleman,&#8217;
and walked to Will, panting, as though
a poisoned arrow had pierced me, with an
anguish of emotion I could no longer
support.</p>

<p>&#8216;He came and spoke to me,&#8217; I whispered.
&#8216;I must have torn his eyes out had I listened
longer.&#8217;</p>

<p>I went down the ladder and stood near
the wheel. Mr. Bates stepped over from
the gangway to tell me that he believed the
carpenter Nodder was a dying man. &#8216;He
has only shipped himself for us to bury him,&#8217;
said he. &#8216;He&#8217;ll pull no more ropes in this
world.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>&#8216;God won&#8217;t let him die till he confesses,
I hope,&#8217; said I. &#8216;The villain Rotch addressed
me just now, and has made me sick and mad,
Mr. Bates, with his talk of his beautiful ship,
the <i>Arab Chief</i>. When will those islanders
let us get away?&#8217;</p>

<p>There remained, however, little to be
done. They had chocked and secured the
quarter-boat, and were now gathered in a
group round the parcels of clothing they had
agreed to take in exchange for watering us
and for provisions. Bates left me to join them.
Daly said they were well satisfied. The old
man then told the others to pass the bundles
into the whale-boat. Just over my head
stood Rotch talking with Will. He was
speaking of me, asked if I was a relation of
the captain, if I lived at Cape Town, and so
forth. He also said, &#8216;What&#8217;s your captain&#8217;s
name?&#8217; to which Will responded, as I had,
by running down the ladder as though he
had not heeded the inquiry because of some
sudden call upon his attention.</p>

<p>The islanders now went away. Before
going, Daly and the others shook hands with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
us. The old man-of-war&#8217;s man, holding my
hand, exclaimed, &#8216;Bless your pretty face,
miss! It calls up my old home to me. Ye&#8217;ll
not take an old man&#8217;s blessing amiss. May
God be wi&#8217; ye, and my prayer shall go along
wi&#8217; ye for your safety.&#8217; He then, with the
others, called a farewell to Rotch, who
remained on top of the deck-house, looking
down, and in a few minutes the white whale-boat,
with her simple, hearty, honest crew,
was pulling away for the lonely, towering
island.</p>

<p>Mr. Bates bade the new hand Collins ship
the gangway. Rotch came down and looked
at the compass that stood before the little
wheel; I was nigh, and he took but a peep
on seeing me.</p>

<p>&#8216;Johnstone, take the wheel,&#8217; said the mate,
&#8216;whilst we swing the yards.&#8217;</p>

<p>He and Collins walked to the maintopsail
brace; Rotch followed and pulled with
them.</p>

<p>They braced the yards fore and aft, and
whilst they were belaying the ropes in the
waist I heard Rotch say, &#8216;This is a taut<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
bowline, isn&#8217;t it, for a northerly wind and an
east-by-north course?&#8217; The mate did not
answer.</p>

<p>The brig was at this time under topsails
and foresail only and some fore and aft canvas.
The wind had scanted, but blew a weak
air; the breasts of the sails lifted, and the
stem of the brig drove ripples from the bows,
and the giant mass of land on the starboard
quarter slid almost imperceptibly into the
wake.</p>

<p>&#8216;Collins,&#8217; cried Bates, &#8216;take the wheel
from that young gentleman.&#8217;</p>

<p>The mate then stepped up to me, leaving
Rotch in the waist, that is, near the little
caboose.</p>

<p>&#8216;Now,&#8217; said he, looking somewhat pale,
&#8216;what&#8217;s next to be done?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Call Rotch aft,&#8217; said I; &#8216;I&#8217;ll bring Captain
Butler out.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Collins,&#8217; said the mate, &#8216;keep her just as
she goes. Captain Rotch, will you please
step this way into the cabin?&#8217;</p>

<p>I went in first; Bates and Will followed.
I saw Rotch coming as I knocked on Tom&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
door and entered. My sweetheart stood
against his bunk, one hand gripping the edge
of it, and his head inclined forward in a
strained, hearkening posture. His face was
colourless, the expression hard and set; his
eyes shone under the shadow of a frown of
fierce determination.</p>

<p>I said, speaking with difficulty, so great
was my agitation: &#8216;The islanders have left
the brig. We have started, and the man&#8217;s in
the cabin.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Bates and Will? They must hear and
see.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;They, too, are in the cabin.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Where&#8217;s Nodder?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Lying ill in the forecastle.&#8217;</p>

<p>On this he opened the door and went out;
I was at his heels. Rotch stood on the other
side of the cabin table, Will at the foot, and
near him Bates; Rotch was at that instant
addressing the mate. When he saw Tom the
movement of his lips was arrested as though
he had been shot through the heart. He
stared in a sort of gaping way&mdash;the expression
is not to be described. Let me call it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
chilling, benumbing amazement, with horror
and fear, like a sort of life, creeping into it.
I had read of men changing colour under
mental tension of an extravagant kind; I
witnessed this now; whilst Rotch looked,
gaping, the blankness of amazement taking a
vitality from the incrawling horror, his balls
of sight strained as though he beheld his fate
in the form of some frightful phantom, his
complexion changed colour; not from the
white of fear to the crimson of rage; it
turned, whilst I looked, into a sort of dim,
blueish purple, as if he had been poisoned.
His lips then moved and he stammered out,
in a voice that was half a scream&mdash;the words
bursting from him&mdash;&#8216;You here!&#8217; The next
instant he sprang toward the door. But Tom
stood close to the entrance; with a single
stride he blocked the way, and said, &#8216;Stand
back!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Let me go!&#8217; cried Rotch, suddenly recovering
the full use of his lungs. &#8216;Mr.
Bates, help me to signal the island boat. She&#8217;s
not ashore yet. That man means to murder
me. You&#8217;re not going to stand by and allow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
him to take my life? Let me go! There&#8217;s
time to recall the boat. That man means
to take my life. I call upon you to help and
save me. I never suspected this!&#8217;</p>

<p>He plunged afresh at the door. I don&#8217;t
doubt that terror and rage gave him the
strength of two or even three men at that
moment; yet Tom met him as he came,
caught him by the throat and hurled him
against the bulkhead from which he had run,
driving him against the solid wooden wall
with a crash which you&#8217;d think should have
beaten him in recoil senseless upon his face.</p>

<p>&#8216;No violence, no violence, I beg, gentlemen!&#8217;
shouted the mate.</p>

<p>&#8216;But a step and I&#8217;ll strangle you!&#8217; said
Tom, making a single stride toward Rotch.</p>

<p>&#8216;Collins,&#8217; roared the villain, &#8216;they&#8217;ve
brought me into this ship to murder me!
Help! I&#8217;m your captain! Quick, Collins!
Signal to the whale-boat! Port your helm for
the island&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;</p>

<p>Will rushed to the door.</p>

<p>&#8216;Stop where you are!&#8217; he shouted.
&#8216;There&#8217;s no murder being done here! Nobody&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
going to be hurt! Keep your luff!
If you&#8217;re just a little bit off your course you
will be sent to hell!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Marian, Bates, Johnstone,&#8217; exclaimed
Tom, pointing at Rotch, &#8216;that&#8217;s the man
you have sometimes heard me name! He is
called Rotch&mdash;Samuel Rotch. He was my
chief mate aboard the <i>Arab Chief</i>. I gave
you the story last night. You saw how I
dealt with him just now. It was in that way
I served him at Valparaiso when the toad insulted
a lady of my acquaintance at a dance
there. That was the man who slept in his
watch on deck when the sea was thick with
shipping. He lost his berth, but I got him
another; and I let him serve under me in the
<i>Arab Chief</i>, when he was named as chief
mate. You, Rotch!&#8217; He drew a pistol from
his pocket&mdash;one of the brace we had found
in the brig&mdash;and put it upon the table. For
some while he eyed Rotch steadily in silence.
I believed he meant to shoot him. Had he
offered, I, standing close beside, should have
struck away the hand that attempted to
hinder him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>Rotch looked ghastly. He trembled from
head to foot. His hands worked with a
strange, spasmodic motion, as though he
would lift and clasp them in entreaty.</p>

<p>&#8216;You Rotch,&#8217; repeated Tom, after a silence
that had lasted at least a minute&mdash;a
minute that seemed an hour; &#8216;we were on
very good terms during the first part of our
voyage. I talked to you somewhat freely,
told you of my engagement with this young
lady, of my venture in the barque, and to what
extent I had protected it, and I spoke hopefully
of the voyage to you. And all the time
you were plotting my ruin. Was it that you
hated me for that little affair at Valparaiso?
For reporting you and losing you a berth?
For holding command in a ship which you
supposed you&#8217;d obtain charge of if you could
get me out of the road? Surely, you Rotch,
these provided but shabby foundations for
the heavy weight of villainy you constructed
upon them.&#8217;</p>

<p>At this point he picked up the pistol and
replaced it in his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8216;What was your scheme? Nodder was
second mate and carpenter. What you promised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
him, how you bribed him, I don&#8217;t know.
He&#8217;ll tell me before he dies. But what you did
was this: You took an auger from his tool-chest.
You and he pierced the skin and side
in the lazarette. You plugged the inner skin,
hid the auger in my cabin&mdash;you found it easily
enough afterwards!&mdash;took men to listen to the
water flowing, brought them into my berth,
searched for the auger, charged me with attempting
to scuttle the ship, and made a
prisoner of me. Was this so?&#8217;</p>

<p>Rotch stood listening, with his eyes fixed
upon the deck. He made no answer.</p>

<p>&#8216;Marian,&#8217; said Tom, &#8216;you were present at
my trial. You remember how glibly he gave
his evidence and answered questions on his
oath. Will he take his oath now that his
story was true? You Rotch, here stands my
friend Bates, who has judged me throughout
a wronged man; here stands Miss Johnstone&#8217;s
cousin, who believes me innocent; here stands
that Miss Johnstone about whom I have so
often talked to you. They hear me. They
will listen to you. Is it true that I attempted
to scuttle the <i>Arab Chief</i>?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>Rotch kept silence.</p>

<p>&#8216;Bates, Johnstone,&#8217; continued Tom, &#8216;you
see how it is? He swore it on the Bible. He
made a felon of me. He ruined my life&mdash;broke
my heart. He&#8217;s mute now. Observe
him. Does he fear to speak because I&#8217;m
armed?&#8217;</p>

<p>He whipped the pistol out of his pocket,
pointed it down and fired it into the deck.</p>

<p>&#8216;Now, take courage! Speak! Did I attempt
to scuttle the <i>Arab Chief</i>, or was the
charge yours and Nodder&#8217;s conspiracy against
me?&#8217;</p>

<p>The man, with an ashen face, now folded
his arms, but made no reply, keeping his eyes
still rooted to the deck.</p>

<p>&#8216;Captain Rotch,&#8217; exclaimed Mr. Bates, &#8216;it&#8217;s
clear to my mind&mdash;it&#8217;s been clear to me all
through&mdash;that you&#8217;ve done this gentleman
such a horrible wrong that no fiend could
imagine anything worse or more cruel! Act
the man now and own to it. Clear him, and
by so doing sweeten your own conscience
against that call which&#8217;ll be coming to you
from God sooner or later. You&#8217;ll fare less ill<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
by shelling out than by keeping silent. Look,
man, how you are in our power!&#8217;</p>

<p>At these words Rotch lifted his eyes and
gazed steadily at Tom. Never could I have
imagined such an expression of hate in the
human face. He gazed, then sank his eyes
again, but never spoke.</p>

<p>&#8216;Rotch, you shall have time,&#8217; Tom said.
&#8216;In this brig you remain till the confession
you dictate has been signed by you and witnessed
by those who are in the vessel. Time
you shall have. Its duration Mr. Bates and I
will settle. If at the expiration of the time I
allow you refuse to prove me the innocent
man you know me to be, then, by the Eternal
God of heaven and justice, I&#8217;ll hang you at
the yardarm!&#8217;</p>

<p>This said, he strode to the after end of
the cabin, and opening the door of the last
berth on the port side, he cried out, &#8216;Walk
in here!&#8217;</p>

<p>Rotch raised his head and slowly looked
around him. A wonderful change had happened
in the man&#8217;s countenance. He was
bloated and swollen. Parts of his face were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
livid, and parts a ghastly white. His eyes had
a strained appearance and seemed to project.
I once saw a man tumble down in a fit near
my house at Stepney, and Rotch&#8217;s face reminded
me of that man&#8217;s when they turned
him over and lifted his head.</p>

<p>&#8216;Walk into this berth!&#8217; cried Tom.</p>

<p>This time the villain obeyed. He moved
slowly, supporting himself by the table as he
went. He entered the little cabin, and Tom
shut the door and locked it.</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;s as much astounded as frightened,&#8217;
said Bates. &#8216;Surely he&#8217;d have thought to
meet any one down here sooner than you.
Where would he reckon you are, Butler, if
not across the seas? Not afloat and in charge
of a smart little brig, anyhow.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Tom,&#8217; said I, &#8216;he&#8217;ll hang rather than
confess. He looked at you with a horribly
malicious, wicked eye.&#8217;</p>

<p>My sweetheart came to the table and
leaned upon it to breathe and rally. He was
very pale, but his eyes glowed with the light
of a savage satisfaction, and his general expression
was one of sullen, wrathful exultation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
The hour was now about four o&#8217;clock. We
had made no mid-day meal. I asked Tom if
I should get some dinner for the little company
of us.</p>

<p>&#8216;Aye,&#8217; said he; &#8216;but first I want a word
with our new hand. Take the wheel from
him, Will, and send him in.&#8217;</p>

<p>The man Collins entered, dangling his
Scotch cap. He was scared; the pistol report
had no doubt frightened him heartily. The
wheel stood right in front of the house, the
door and little windows were open, and the
man would need to be deaf not to hear what
had passed.</p>

<p>&#8216;What is your name?&#8217; said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8216;John Collins, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What was your rating aboard the <i>Arab
Chief</i>?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Able seaman, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m master of this little brig till I find an
owner for her,&#8217; said Tom. &#8216;We&#8217;re going to
work her north so as to get Great Britain
handy aboard, should any of us turn sick of
the sea and want to go ashore. We&#8217;re not
bound to the Cape, as you&#8217;ve been led to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
believe. It&#8217;s all the same to you, I suppose?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;d rather make a straight passage home,
of course,&#8217; answered the man.</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;re not pirates, as what you&#8217;ve been
listening to might lead you to fear. You can
cheer up, my lad, reckon that you&#8217;ve got a
good berth, and that all will go well with you.
See here, now: I commanded the <i>Arab Chief</i>
when Rotch was her chief mate and Nodder
second and carpenter. Those two scoundrels
swore that I attempted to scuttle her to defraud
the insurance offices; they brought me
before the court and got me sentenced to a term
of transportation. I happen to be here in this
brig off the island of Tristan d&#8217;Acunha when
they, along with you, are sent aboard me as
shipwrecked men wanting to get away. This
is the act of God, Collins! Collins, it&#8217;s a large
and beautiful mercy shown to a broken-hearted
man, and an opportunity he&#8217;s been made too
much of a devil by Rotch to despise. Before
my two villains leave this brig they sign a
confession, declaring that their charge against
me was a shocking, horrible lie; that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
themselves made the holes in the barque and
hid the auger in my cabin. Rotch is the
bigger villain; the other&#8217;s an illiterate, drunken
scoundrel. Rotch shall have time granted
him if he&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Tom,&#8217; I interrupted, &#8216;Collins wants to
speak.&#8217;</p>

<p>I had been watching the fellow whilst my
sweetheart addressed him, and observed his
face take a sort of colour and grow full of
meaning. Tom arrested his speech. Collins,
twisting his Scotch cap in both hands, exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8216;Captain, it&#8217;s come upon me now! I
had a sort o&#8217; fancy o&#8217; &#8217;t whilst I stood
a-listening. You&#8217;ll be the party meant, and
I&#8217;ll just give you what&#8217;s in my head whilst
I&#8217;ve got it. I was at the wheel one night
from ten to twelve, about a fortnight afore
we was burnt out of the ship.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You mean the <i>Arab Chief</i>?&#8217; said Mr.
Bates.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh yes!&#8217; I cried wildly. &#8216;For God&#8217;s
sake, don&#8217;t interrupt him, Mr. Bates!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, as I says,&#8217; continued the man, after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
a pause and a slow, unintelligent stare at me,
&#8216;I was at the wheel. Nodder, he had charge
of the deck. He&#8217;d been drinking. I&#8217;ll say here
that that there Nodder was never off drinking.
I don&#8217;t believe he was sober two hours
together down to the moment when we was
burnt out. He gives me a certain course to
steer by. &#8217;Twarn&#8217;t the course the chap I&#8217;d
relieved had named. The capt&#8217;n&mdash;that&#8217;s
Rotch&mdash;comes up, looks into the binnacle,
calls Nodder, and hazes him for being off his
course. Nodder gives it him back. I reckon
that the capt&#8217;n had taken a drop too much
himself. They clenches fists, and snorts all
kinds of insults at each other. Nodder says:
&#8220;I&#8217;ll gibbet ye yet for a bloody conspirator
against an honester man than ever slept in
your fired skin. &#8217;Twas you who put me up
to that job. I ha&#8217;n&#8217;t had no peace since,
and where is my fifty pounds?&#8221; Here Rotch
whispers through his teeth and takes him by
the arm, and falls a-shoving of him out of my
hearing. And still Nodder sings out whilst
t&#8217;other was a-shoving: &#8220;I&#8217;ll gibbet ye yet.
The lie was yourn, the whole b&#8217;iling of it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
yourn. Who hid the auger? Who told me
to spin that yarn to the crew about the capt&#8217;n
coming for&#8217;ards to ask me to lend him an
auger?&#8221;&#8217;</p>

<p>Tom struck the table a furious blow with
his clenched fist.</p>

<p>&#8216;Tell us all you know, Collins,&#8217; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why,&#8217; said he, picking up his cap and
fastening a nervous eye on Tom, &#8216;that&#8217;s
pretty nigh all I do know. They shut up
arter this and went below for a drink, then
walked the deck. Capt&#8217;n Rotch seemed to
make nothen of my overhearing him, as
though &#8217;twasn&#8217;t a business the likes of me
was going to trouble his head over. And he
was right. I don&#8217;t recollect mentioning what
I&#8217;d heard except once, about a week afore
we was burnt out, when there was some
trouble over the starboard watch&#8217;s allowance
of sugar; then I tells one of my mates that
the capt&#8217;n and Nodder had got some dirty
secret between them, and that each seemed
in t&#8217;other&#8217;s power. But nothen was made
of this, and then comes the fire. It whips
into my head whilst I stood a-listening to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
ye just now, and, capt&#8217;n, I&#8217;ve told ye the
truth.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;This should be taken down,&#8217; said Bates.</p>

<p>&#8216;Can you write, Collins?&#8217; asked Tom.</p>

<p>The man, with a grin, answered &#8216;No.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Give Collins a glass of grog,&#8217; said Tom.</p>

<p>I mixed a draught, and the man drank
our health. Tom then said:</p>

<p>&#8216;Collins, will you dictate to this lady the
yarn you&#8217;ve just spun us?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Willingly, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I thank you,&#8217; said Tom.</p>

<p>He then bade me procure writing materials
whilst he and Bates went to the forecastle to
look at Nodder. I told Collins to sit, and
wrote down just as he talked. I felt heartily
grateful to the man; here, now, was a piece
of valuable testimony in Tom&#8217;s favour; this
sailor, when he told his story, did not even
know the name of the man he was addressing;
and then, how could he have invented that
stroke about the auger and that other point
which had made Tom strike the table&mdash;I
mean the statement that Captain Butler had
asked Nodder for the loan of the auger?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>I was so pleased that, guessing he might
be hungry, I put before him the best cold
meal I could hastily collect, and made him
drink some wine. Indeed, I waited upon
him as though this poor, plain, silly-eyed
sailor had been Tom himself. I asked many
questions about Rotch and Nodder. He had
nothing very ill to say of Rotch; Nodder he
called a drunken, bungersome nughead. (He
was of Somersetshire.)</p>

<p>When he had finished eating he relieved
Will. I told my cousin to see to the galley
fire and laid the cloth for a late dinner, and
whilst I was thus busy, Tom and Bates, talking
together very earnestly, came along the
deck and entered the cabin. I showed my
sweetheart what I had taken down; he said:
&#8216;Let the man put his mark here, and the
three of you witness it whilst I hold the
wheel.&#8217;</p>

<p>Bates read the deposition aloud, and then
Collins made a cross, and we signed our
names. This was a precious document. I
would not have parted with it for all I was
worth. I put it carefully away in the desk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
we had found in the cabin I occupied, and
then returning I eagerly asked Tom what he
had to tell me about Nodder.</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;s a surly, stubborn hound,&#8217; said he;
&#8216;very ill, and, in my opinion, dying. We
lighted the forecastle lamp; we found him
lying in the dark and groaning now and
again. I stood apart while Bates spoke to
him. Bates asked him how he did. He answered,
with an oath, that he felt very low.
Bates long-windedly put further questions to
him. He then said: &#8220;D&#8217;ye know what brig
you&#8217;re aboard of?&#8221; &#8220;The <i>Old Stormy</i>, ain&#8217;t
it?&#8221; says Nodder. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; says Bates; &#8220;and
d&#8217;ye know who her captain is?&#8221; &#8220;No,&#8221; answers
the carpenter. &#8220;He&#8217;s Captain Butler,&#8221;
says Bates, &#8220;who was in command of the
<i>Arab Chief</i>, that you and Rotch charged him
with attempting to scuttle.&#8221; The man lay
silent a bit, and then said: &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe
it.&#8221; &#8220;Rotch does,&#8221; said Bates; &#8220;he&#8217;s locked
up, and Captain Butler means to hang him if,
after a given time, he doesn&#8217;t confess that
you and he conspired together to ruin him.&#8221;
Here Nodder, who had been lying on his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
back all this while, sat up and said: &#8220;There&#8217;s
no Butler in this ship. I heered him sentenced,
and he was lagged for fourteen year.&#8221;
On this I stepped out of the eyes of the forecastle,
where I had stood unobserved, and
coming under the lamp, where he could see
me plainly, I said: &#8220;D&#8217;ye know me? Your
memory should be as good as Rotch&#8217;s.&#8221; The
scoundrel looked, shut his eyes, looked,
blinked and looked again, cursed awhile, and
lay back. I&#8217;d made up my mind to head on
a new tack with this fellow&mdash;that is, to trim
him differently from my handling of Rotch.
I said quietly: &#8220;Nodder, you&#8217;re a sick and a
dying man. How did you serve me who
never injured you? You ruined me, made a
convict of me, broke my heart. You were
a tool in Rotch&#8217;s hands, and I believe you&#8217;d
have undone the mischief before we reached
England had you found courage. Rotch was
the villain, you were his instrument.&#8221; He
now turned his head to look at me, and lay
like a corpse with his eyes fastened upon my
face. I couldn&#8217;t swear that he had his mind,
that he clearly understood; the fright and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
wonder of seeing me stirred the mud in his
soul and thickened his brain. Still I talked
on. I told him that I had Rotch under lock
and key, and should hang him if he didn&#8217;t
confess. I repeated what Collins had told
me. I then said that my enemy was Rotch;
that he was the man I meant to get at and
punish. &#8220;If you&#8217;ll dictate the truth to me,&#8221;
said I, &#8220;tell us the full story of the diabolical
plot, and sign it, that your signature may be
witnessed, I&#8217;ll let you go. If you live to get
north, I&#8217;ll put you ashore, and you shall be
no more troubled, unless you are willing to
turn Queen&#8217;s evidence so as to help me to
bring Rotch to his trial.&#8221; This was, in effect,
what I said. I spoke quietly, even kindly.
Like Rotch, he made no answer; he lay looking
at me, and when I had done, still looked;
and I waited for him to speak. Bates implored
him to confess. The fellow, silent as
a ghost, turned over in his bunk and gave us
his back. But it was early times. I was
resolved not to threaten him. After waiting,
I said to Bates, &#8220;We&#8217;ll go.&#8221; As we passed
through the hatch, he called out in his harsh,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
hideous voice, though feebly enough: &#8220;Won&#8217;t
you send me a drop of sperrits? I don&#8217;t
want nothin&#8217; to eat.&#8221; &#8220;You shall be attended
to,&#8221; said I, and we came away.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What hopes of him have you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He may be brought to confess.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Would his unsupported confession suffice,
Tom?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Suffice for what?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;To obtain a full pardon.&#8217;</p>

<p>He looked at me gravely, then, with a
slight smile, said: &#8216;We&#8217;ll think of the navigation
of the brig for the present, and talk of
full pardons by-and-by.&#8217;</p>

<small>SHE WITNESSES NODDER&#8217;S CONFESSION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> islanders had brought some fresh meat
on board; I fried a steak, also boiled some
eggs, potatoes, and vegetables. Taking the
<i>Childe Harold</i> first, and now this <i>Old Stormy</i>,
we had been keeping the sea many weeks.
Tom&#8217;s fare in the convict ship had been the
prison&#8217;s, Will had fed upon forecastle food,
Mr. Bates and I had done just a little better&mdash;he
at the cabin table and I at the scrap
basket. The island produce, then, must make
us a delicious meal.</p>

<p>The island was about three hours astern
of us, distant about ten or twelve miles, a pile
of sapphire, and the sea was of the same
beautiful hue. The sky in the north was
frosted with snow-white cloud running in
links like chains, with a little plumy shooting
as of mares&#8217; tails along the advanced brow of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
the delicately compacted stuff. The wind
blew out of that quarter; it was a dead-on-end
wind for us; but the brig, under topsails
and foresail, looked well up; and now that
Will had loosed the fore and main topgallant-sails,
which had been sheeted home and
the yards hoisted whilst I was in the galley,
the little vessel was beginning to buzz over
the wide blue heave of swell, and the wrinkles
from her cutwater broke into thin lines of
snow abreast of the gangways, as her nimble
and metalled forefoot ate its way to windward.</p>

<p>I spied a white sail down in the south-west.
She looked to be standing for the
island. It was as likely as not we had been
just in time to secure Messrs. Rotch and
Nodder.</p>

<p>The discipline of the little ship had been
settled by the hour I had done with my
cooking. We were now four sailors and a
girl who could make herself generally useful.</p>

<p>Whilst I was dishing the dinner, Will told
me he had carried a pannikin of rum and
some bread and meat into the forecastle.
Nodder drained the pannikin, but refused the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
food. Will accosted him civilly, having received
his cue from Tom. The brute, after
drinking, sat up and asked how it was that
Captain Butler was out of quod. &#8216;He was
transported for fourteen years,&#8217; he said. &#8216;He&#8217;s
got eleven or twelve year to sarve yet. Who&#8217;s
the smothered bloke that was down here
a-calling of hisself Captain Butler?&#8217; Will
answered: &#8216;Rotch knows.&#8217; &#8216;What&#8217;s been
done to him?&#8217; &#8216;He&#8217;s locked up just now,&#8217;
says Will. &#8216;Are they a-going to hang him?&#8217;
&#8216;If he don&#8217;t confess.&#8217; On this Nodder lay
back and turned his face to the brig&#8217;s side,
and Will came away.</p>

<p>When we sat down to dinner, Collins being
at the helm, Tom cut some beef and filled
a tumbler half full of wine, and sent the meal
by Mr. Bates to Rotch. Bates was some time
in the cabin with the villain; indeed, his own
dinner was cooling. Suddenly Tom jumped
up, and, going to my berth, which he used
when he worked out his sights, the navigating
instruments and charts being there, fetched
some writing-paper, pen and ink. Bates at
that moment appeared at the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
cabin; Tom called to him, &#8216;Oblige me by
putting these things into Rotch&#8217;s berth.&#8217;</p>

<p>Bates did so, locked the door, sat down,
and fell to his meal.</p>

<p>&#8216;Did he speak?&#8217; said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; said the mate. &#8216;He has an evil eye.
He&#8217;s aged ten years, too. He said: &#8220;Captain
Butler talks of hanging me. Does he mean
it?&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said I; &#8220;but you know how to
save your life.&#8221; &#8220;He hang me! That &#8217;u&#8217;d be
murder! Curse him! You&#8217;re a brother
sailor. Would you stand by and allow it to be
done?&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m no brother sailor of yours,&#8221; said
I. &#8220;Right the man you&#8217;ve diabolically wronged
by making a clean breast of your wickedness.
If you don&#8217;t, there&#8217;s never a brother sailor
aboard this brig that won&#8217;t pull all his beef into
the rope that yardarms ye!&#8221; I thought he&#8217;d
fling himself upon me. His face was as full
of devilish malice as you could have squeezed
out of all hands aboard the convict ship.
I put down his grub and came away. He
didn&#8217;t speak when I took in the paper
and ink.&#8217;</p>

<p>The subject was changed, and the talk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
that followed mainly concerned the routine
to be adopted.</p>

<p>When I had cleared the table I stepped out
to look at the island, and saw no more than
a large, faint shadow seventeen or eighteen
miles away. The wind had veered a trifle,
and we were making a better course for the
northern climb, though where we were bound
to I no more knew than how this wild, strange
adventure was to end. I felt weary, and,
entering the deck-house, sat down at the foremost
end of the table close to Tom&#8217;s cabin-door.
I leaned my cheek on my hand and
gave myself up to thought. Strange as it
may seem, I was sensible of a secret grievous
disappointment that the island scheme was
closed. I longed to be Tom&#8217;s wife. Had we
arranged with Governor Glass to settle at
Tristan, I might in a few weeks have been
Tom&#8217;s bride. At this rate, when were we to
be married? If my sweetheart waited for
Rotch to speak, the villain might keep us
sailing about for months; unless, indeed,
Tom hanged him, which was less likely to
happen as time cooled his blood and mine.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
And, certainly, to hang the man would be to
murder him, as already I understood; though
assuredly had Tom put the yardarm rope into
my hand and bade me pull, I&#8217;d have dragged&mdash;on
that or on any other day&mdash;with less
compunction than I&#8217;d have squashed a
spider.</p>

<p>Whilst I thus sat thinking over such matters
as these, in stepped Will; he looked about
and sat down. I heard a noise of feet overhead,
and guessed that Tom and Bates walked
the deck together. The sailor Collins steered;
the sunset glowed like a sheet of burning gold
upon the skylight.</p>

<p>&#8216;Marian,&#8217; said Will, &#8216;how long is this
roaming to last?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I wish I could tell you,&#8217; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;Butler&#8217;s one goading idea just now is
revenge. But I want to get home&mdash;rig out
afresh&mdash;sign for a new ship&mdash;and start again.
This sort of thing is merely pickling one. It
will qualify me as a lobscouser, I dare say,
but I&#8217;m learning nothing useful, never have
a quadrant in my hand, and get no jobs of
seamanship to do.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>&#8216;Tom told you he&#8217;ll steer the brig straight
for England, and put you and Bates in the
way of getting home. What more do you
want? But for him you&#8217;d have been
murdered by the convicts. Or you might be
lying dead in an open boat along with Captain
Sutherland and the others. But you&#8217;re
safe, and Tom&#8217;s steering you home.&#8217;</p>

<p>I spoke hotly and raised my voice. He
stammered; he had not before taken this
view of his deliverance perhaps.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well,&#8217; said he, &#8216;but look here, Marian;
granted that Butler sends Bates and me
home; you stay behind, what&#8217;s to become of
you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s my business.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Not yours only. I&#8217;m closer to you than
Butler till you&#8217;re married. I&#8217;ve a right to
consider your safety, anyway. You&#8217;re here
through my help; your convict ship adventure
was of my bringing about. It&#8217;s my duty
to see you safe out of the mess your romancing
love has carried you into.&#8217;</p>

<p>An angry answer was on my lips when
the door of the berth close beside me was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
opened, and Tom stepped out. I had not
imagined he was there. Will changed colour.
My sweetheart, with the pleasantest smile I
had yet seen on his face, put his hand on the
lad&#8217;s shoulder, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8216;I couldn&#8217;t help overhearing you, Johnstone.
But I&#8217;m in time, I hope, to stop more
from being said than you&#8217;d wish me to
catch. I admire your devotion to your cousin
and thank you for it. It is what I should
expect of one with Marian&#8217;s blood in him.
Step this way, that our friend in the after-cabin
yonder may not hear me.&#8217;</p>

<p>He led us into the berth I slept in, and
closed the door.</p>

<p>&#8216;Johnstone,&#8217; said he, &#8216;I&#8217;ll ask you a question
or two. How do you know that I didn&#8217;t
attempt to scuttle the <i>Arab Chief</i>?&#8217;</p>

<p>The lad looked startled, and answered: &#8216;I
don&#8217;t know, yet I&#8217;ll swear you never made the
attempt.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You wish to think me innocent, but you
can&#8217;t be sure?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;On the top of Collins&#8217;s story I am sure,&#8217;
said Will.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>&#8216;Chaw! What is that evidence? Mere
hearsay; the talk of a scoundrel seaman perhaps
against his captain, and it&#8217;s two to one
still even at that. How is Bates to know I&#8217;m
guiltless? How is Marian, except of her
great love and noble devotion and faith in me,
to hold me innocent of a charge on which an
intelligent jury and a sagacious judge condemned
me, imprisoned me, expatriated me?
Now,&#8217; said he, talking with perfect temper,
&#8216;I&#8217;ve a right to prove myself an honest man
to you all, haven&#8217;t I? The machinery of
proof, by a marvellous ordering of Providence,
happens to be on board; I&#8217;m a little at a loss
how to handle it; advise me, Johnstone.&#8217;</p>

<p>I seated myself at this point, and he put
his arm round my neck, with a light, sarcastic
smile as he looked at the lad.</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s nothing to be done but wring
the truth out of the beast,&#8217; said Will.</p>

<p>&#8216;How? As you wring a swab! Advise
me, Johnstone.&#8217;</p>

<p>My cousin coloured, looked down, and
was silent.</p>

<p>&#8216;My lad,&#8217; said Tom, after a pause, &#8216;you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
cannot counsel me. Of course not. Neither
can Bates. What&#8217;s the key, then, to fit this
lock? Why, patience. And patience means
that I must keep my brace of villains aboard
this brig till they confess, or sicken and die,
never parting with them till I&#8217;ve torn the
jewel they&#8217;ve robbed me of out of their black
hearts. If I send you home you&#8217;ll have
nothing to complain of!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, sir. But Marian&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Marian shall accompany you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Never!&#8217; I cried, flinging his arm from
my neck to look at him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Marian,&#8217; he said tenderly, &#8216;you will do
what I wish when the time comes. No man
could swiftly strike out of such an amazing
business as this a full and satisfying plan.
You&#8217;ll do what I wish, and help me by
obeying.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But you mean to hang Rotch, Captain
Butler?&#8217; said Will.</p>

<p>&#8216;In time I may, Johnstone, even if I have
to carry him to the South Seas to do it. But
the villain&#8217;s span, you see, is not yet allotted,
as far as I am concerned.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>&#8216;Captain,&#8217; said Will, &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry I interfered
or spoke to Marian. You&#8217;re a man
of honour; you&#8217;ll do what&#8217;s right by my
cousin.&#8217;</p>

<p>Tom smiled at him.</p>

<p>&#8216;You will never get me to leave you!&#8217;
said I, jumping up and grasping my sweetheart&#8217;s
arm.</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re tired, dear; the air is soft on
deck, the evening is cloudless and beautiful.
Wrap yourself up and I&#8217;ll carry a chair for
you on to the deck-house roof.&#8217;</p>

<p>But matters were to come to a head more
swiftly than ever I had dared dream. We
had left Tristan five days behind us. In all
this time the brig had gnawed her way to
windward on a taut bowline, the breeze holding
fresh and steady off the bow, the blue seas
flowing in long, deep lines. Rotch throughout
was waited upon by Mr. Bates. And first
as to this man Rotch.</p>

<p>I frequently questioned the mate about
him, and gathered this: He spoke little and
ate poorly; he craved for drink as though he
burnt with a perpetual thirst of fever; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
Bates put plenty of fresh water into his cabin,
and rum enough to poison him out of hand, if
ever he should have a mind for what I would
now call a Barney-Abram drench. Bates told
us the fellow was growing very thin in the
face and falling away in the body; already
his clothes were fitting him ill. He was restless,
and Bates seldom entered his cabin without
finding him pacing the little square of
deck. It was Tom&#8217;s wish that Bates should
attend to the man; he was afraid to trust
himself with him; and Will was young and
green, and might by some well-meant whisper
balk my sweetheart&#8217;s scheme to terrify the
man into a confession of truth.</p>

<p>Once, when Bates went in with the prisoner&#8217;s
dinner, Rotch, leaning against his bunk
with his arms folded&mdash;so the mate described
him&mdash;asked where they were sailing the brig
to. Bates answered plainly, &#8216;To England.&#8217;
Rotch said: &#8216;What does the man Butler mean
to do with me?&#8217; Bates replied: &#8216;He means
to keep you with him till you prove his innocence;
time will be granted; if you then fail,
he&#8217;ll hang you. He&#8217;s a man of his word;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
when you made a convict of him, you made a
devil of him. He no longer holds human life
in value. He&#8217;d shoot you through the head
with as easy a heart as a felon brains a
warder.&#8217; &#8216;Suppose I do what he wants&mdash;what
then?&#8217; asked Rotch. &#8216;I don&#8217;t know,&#8217;
answered Bates. &#8216;Find out,&#8217; said the man.
(When this was put to Tom, he said: &#8216;Let
him confess, let the document bear his signature
and be properly witnessed, and I&#8217;ll hand
him over to you, Bates&mdash;to you and to Will
along with this brig and cargo&mdash;I&#8217;ll leave
you in the Channel by the first Frenchman
who&#8217;ll put me ashore in his country; what
Miss Johnstone will do we&#8217;ll consider. First
let the man confess.&#8217;) This was repeated to
Rotch, who said to the mate: &#8216;What would
you do with me?&#8217; &#8216;Establish Captain
Butler&#8217;s innocence,&#8217; answers the mate. &#8216;The
sooner you do it, the better you&#8217;ll be used.&#8217;
Rotch made no answer.</p>

<p>From this time, during the days I am now
dealing with, he continued obstinately silent,
a sullen, scowling figure of a man as Bates
pictured him, losing flesh as though he fasted,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
asking for nothing but fresh water to mix his
rum with; for nothing but that. The brig
had a few books; the mate placed two or
three in Rotch&#8217;s berth; they were never
touched. Thus it was with Captain Samuel
Rotch, whom I never once set eyes on
after the day when he had been ordered into
his berth and locked up by Tom. He was
perfectly quiet; I&#8217;d sometimes fancy I heard
a noise like a muttering, and I&#8217;d creep to his
door to listen, hoping to hear him babble
about Tom in a fit of delirium or out of the
liquor which Bates told us he swallowed in
quantities. But it was always imagination on
my part; his berth was for ever as silent as a
coffin.</p>

<p>As for Nodder&mdash;Mr. Bates waited upon
that man for the reason that he waited upon
Rotch. Tom distrusted his own temper, and
was advised by me and Bates never to go into
the forecastle. It was the mate&#8217;s own wish to
attend upon Nodder; he told me he was
gaining a sort of influence over the fellow,
who was miserably ill and suffering fearfully
from some internal trouble, and who, attempting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
once at Bates&#8217;s suggestion to quit his
bunk and come on deck for fresh air, was in
such agony when he stood that he fell down
in a swoon, and Bates had to put his head
through the scuttle and bawl to Will to help
him pick the man up and put him into his
bunk again.</p>

<p>I never can forget Mr. Bates&#8217;s kindness at
this time. The tears stand in my eyes, and I
find myself loving his memory as that of a
dear friend when I recall his unwearied
anxiety and efforts to get the truth from the
two villains. He was a person of a religious
cast of mind, and in that, I think, strange as
it may seem, lay his influence over Nodder,
who seemed fully sensible that he was a dying
man, and found a sort of consolation in conversing
with the mate. It luckily happened
that there were one or two points of sympathy
between them. For example, Bates&#8217;s mother
had been a native of Nodder&#8217;s birthplace; he
knew the seaport well, and mentioned names,
street&#8217;s, shops, and the like, with which the
man of course was well acquainted. Then
the mate had sailed with a man who commanded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
a ship in which Nodder had made a
voyage, and this man was the only person for
whom Nodder had a good word.</p>

<p>This and much more the mate would tell
Tom and me on his return from his forecastle
visits. But all the while the villain answered
no questions as to my sweetheart&#8217;s guilt or
innocence. He was too wary to say a word
about Rotch, though Bates directly challenged
him on one occasion about that point in
Collins&#8217;s statement, when during the drunken
quarrel Nodder had asked the other what
had become of the fifty pounds he had promised
him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yet,&#8217; said the mate to me, in the course
of a long earnest talk, &#8216;I honestly believe,
Miss Johnstone, the fellow will shell out
before he dies. How long he&#8217;ll take in
sinking I don&#8217;t know. His looks aren&#8217;t sweet
and lively; I&#8217;ve known pleasanter minutes in
my time than talking to that carroty head,
bolstered up, flickering out to the slush lamp
with a dirty old blanket drawn to its throat.
Yet he&#8217;s now fallen into the trick of a wall-eyed
look that makes me hopeful. I seem to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
see the truth rising like a whale coming up to
blow, though before it touches the surface it
settles again.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How long do you give him to live?&#8217;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, a sea-dog of his cut,&#8217; said he, &#8216;often
holds on with such a grip as disappoints the
most humane calculations. It isn&#8217;t so much
dying as drying out. Nature kind of embalms
him, as a Yankee would say. It&#8217;s salt and
sun that does it. This chap might live to be
sent ashore in the English Channel. Just the
sort of a man he is to walk slowly, in shiny
cloth and a face of tallow, out of a hospital,
and sign articles a month afterwards for a
warm voyage.&#8217;</p>

<p>Now, as well as I can remember, it was
two days after this talk with Mr. Bates that I
was in my berth mending my dress with a
needle and thread from a sailor&#8217;s housewife
that had been found in the forecastle. I don&#8217;t
recollect that we had taken the south-east
trade-wind; the yards were square, a fresh,
merry, sparkling breeze blew over the quarter,
and the brig floated fast before it, sitting very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
upright, with a slow, small, majestical curtseying
motion in the length of her as she was
underswept by the Atlantic swell that ran
with the breeze.</p>

<p>Suddenly, someone knocked in an agitated
manner upon my door; I cried: &#8216;Who&#8217;s
there?&#8217;</p>

<p>The voice of Mr. Bates, not less indicative
of excitement than his knuckles, cried: &#8216;I
want paper and ink as quickly as possible,
Miss Johnstone.&#8217;</p>

<p>Here in my berth, which had been the
captain&#8217;s, was kept the brig&#8217;s small stock of
writing materials. Somehow I guessed what
the mate wanted paper and pen for. I
whipped on my dress and opened the door.
He took what he needed, just saying, &#8216;Nodder&#8217;s
offered to confess!&#8217; and hastened away.
My heart at this news leapt up and half
choked me with a sudden transport. It was
drawing on to four o&#8217;clock in the afternoon;
Tom was in his cabin resting. I put on my
hat and went on to the deck and found
Collins at the wheel. Will, who was in Tom&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
watch, according to the disposition of our
little company, was lying down.</p>

<p>Collins exclaimed: &#8216;If you&#8217;re seeking
Mr. Bates, he&#8217;s in the forecastle.&#8217; I paced
up and down in what is called the gangway
between the deck-house front and caboose,
and still, as I turned my back on the fore part
of the brig, I&#8217;d for ever be looking behind me
toward the fore hatch, through which Mr.
Bates must emerge. Saving that time that I
waited for the decision of the jury in the Old
Bailey, I had never suffered such agony of
suspense. Was Nodder dictating to Mr.
Bates at this instant? If so, what was he
saying? Convicting himself and Rotch of as
shocking a perjury as any in the criminal
records, or declaring that the evidence he
and the other had given was true? Would
the sullen, drunken, dying animal dictate at
all when Bates sat beside him ready to write?
These were distracting thoughts, and I walked
the deck like one distraught. I did not want
to see Mr. Bates too soon; I dreaded his
emergence, for that would signify the villain
had fallen stubborn and mute, and yet my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
impatience was an anguish; again and again
I&#8217;d stop in the cabin-doorway to look at the
clock. Collins, who could see the time
through the window, exclaimed: &#8216;It&#8217;s after
four. Will Mr. Johnstone relieve me?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Wait for Mr. Bates,&#8217; said I; and I started
off afresh on my gangway march.</p>

<p>At last, on a sudden, I saw Mr. Bates&#8217;s face
in the hatch; he gravely motioned me to
approach; when I had drawn near he said:
&#8216;It&#8217;s all right; I have it down. It&#8217;s a complete
acquittal. What a piece of villainy!
Pray run aft now, put Captain Butler to the
wheel, and bring Johnstone and Collins into
the forecastle to hear what&#8217;s been written, to
witness Nodder&#8217;s signature, and to sign their
own names.&#8217;</p>

<p>I sped to the cabin and ran breathless
into Tom&#8217;s berth. I put my hand upon his
shoulder and shook him violently. He opened
his eyes and instantly started up, collecting
his wits with the nimble dexterity of one used
to instant and urgent calls.</p>

<p>&#8216;Nodder has confessed!&#8217; I cried. &#8216;Bates
has it down in writing; he wants Will and me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
and Collins in the forecastle as witnesses.
Jump up and take the wheel whilst I call
Will.&#8217;</p>

<p>Before the words were fairly off my lips
he was out of his bunk, pulling on his coat.
I rushed to Will&#8217;s cabin and dragged the dear
boy half out of bed in my eagerness to awaken
and get him forward quickly. His berth was
next to Rotch&#8217;s; the bulkhead between was
stout, but a voice exerted strongly was easily
to be heard through the partition. I cried
out in loud, clear tones that Nodder had confessed
Tom&#8217;s innocence, that Mr. Bates had
taken his statement down in writing, and that
he (Will) was instantly required in the forecastle.</p>

<p>Tom was at the wheel. He had sent
Collins forward. Will and I ran to the forecastle
hatch and descended. I found myself
in a small, gloomy, wooden cave; a lamp
burning with a large, dim, smoky flame
swayed at the end of a lanyard under a grimy
central beam. Some bunks were built on
either hand of this forecastle. The place contained
a sea-chest or two left by the sailors,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
some remains of bedding, a few odds and ends
of wearing apparel. Mr. Bates sat upon a
chest under the lamp; a bunk-board he had
used as a writing-desk stood before him. He
held a sheet of foolscap paper.</p>

<p>In a bunk immediately abreast lay Nodder.
I could not distinguish much of the man.
An old blanket partially covered him. His
arms, clothed in a sleeve-waistcoat, lay outside
the blanket. His colour was sickly,
dingy, hideous. His long red hair, like
peelings and slicings of carrots, stood harsh
and stiff about his brow and coiled wire-like
upon the bolster. His wall-eye seemed to be
fastened upon me; the other looked straight
up. Collins stood near the mate, who, on our
descending, exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll read this confession aloud, that Nodder
may hear it&#8217;s all right. He&#8217;ll then sign, and
we four&#8217;ll witness.&#8217;</p>

<p>Here Nodder turned his head and said:
&#8216;Who&#8217;s that female?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The lady Captain Butler&#8217;s to be married
to,&#8217; answered Mr. Bates.</p>

<p>&#8216;Didn&#8217;t know there was e&#8217;er a woman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
aboard,&#8217; said Nodder, speaking as though his
throat was raw with drink. Nothing so harsh,
rasping, sawlike, did I ever hear.</p>

<p>I got my disgust under and stepped close
to the villain. &#8216;I hope you don&#8217;t suffer much?&#8217;
I said softly and kindly.</p>

<p>&#8216;I do, then,&#8217; he answered. &#8216;When there&#8217;s
hell in the belly and hell in the heart, there&#8217;s
bound to be suffering. It was all along of
that Rotch. Toon up, Mr. Bates, and let&#8217;s get
the gallus job over.&#8217;</p>

<p>I drew back. The having such a face as
his near me made me feel sick. Then, again,
the atmosphere of his bunk was charged with
a smell of spirits, and reminded me of the
fumes which rose through the <i>Childe Harold&#8217;s</i>
skylights that night we left her.</p>

<p>Mr. Bates, standing up, read aloud, in a
solemn and emphatic manner, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8216;September 27, 1835, Samuel Rotch, mate
of the barque <i>Arab Chief</i>, comes to me,
Benjamin Nodder, carpenter of the said ship,
then sitting in my berth forward, smoking a
pipe, and asked me if I&#8217;d give that matter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
he&#8217;d talked to me afore on another thought.
I says yes, and in consideration of his promises
I was agreeable to help him, but he must
contrive the job so artfully as to make sure I
shouldn&#8217;t get into trouble. He answers that
there could be no risks at all; him and me
would be witnesses, and we would take some of
the sailors into the lazarette to hear the water
running in, and then carry them to Captain
Butler&#8217;s berth, where we&#8217;d find the treenail
auger, the sailors looking on. Captain Thomas
Butler was master of the said barque <i>Arab
Chief</i>. The understanding was this: If the
plot answered and Rotch got command he
was to use his interest and make me mate
under him. He was likewise to pay me fifty
pounds on our return to England. This
money&#8217;s still a-owing: he was always putting
off the payment with promises, and swore
when we started that he&#8217;d tell down the
money in Spanish dollars at Callao, to which
port the <i>Arab Chief</i> was bound when she
was burned. It was likewise agreed that I
was to have the run of the spirits after we
had confined Captain Butler to his cabin.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
Rotch told me that the punishment for
scuttling a ship was light, not like the punishment
for actually sinking of her. I didn&#8217;t
suppose it would come to a term of transportation,
or I swear by the blood of my
heart I&#8217;d never have done it. It was to be a
small punishment, Rotch says, that would put
Butler out of the way for a spell&mdash;long enough
to enable Rotch to get command and to give
me a berth at good wages. I made the holes
and plugged the inner skin, and Rotch hid
the auger. It was all Rotch&#8217;s planning, and
I helped. I&#8217;d have owned up several times
when we were going home in the ship-of-war
along with Captain Butler for the trial, but
Rotch told me it was too late, that I&#8217;d already
committed perjury before the Consul at Rio,
and both him and me stood to be transported
for life if I confessed. Captain Butler was
nothing to me one way or the other; I never
liked nor disliked him. Rotch, he hated the
man; never said why. I allow he was ate up
with jealousy; from his toes to his hair he
was fired with it. I&#8217;ll make no excuses for
myself. Drink was at bottom and not caring.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
I never reckoned it would have come to
fourteen years&#8217; transportation. I hope this
here confession will clear Captain Butler&#8217;s
character, and set him right again in the eyes
of the world. And now, willing to sign this
document in the presence of witnesses, I&#8217;ve
got nothing more to say.&#8217;</p></div>

<p>Bates ceased to read.</p>

<p>&#8216;Some one fill my pannikin,&#8217; said Nodder.
&#8216;Hearing that yarn over again&#8217;s taken it out
of me.&#8217;</p>

<p>Bates pointed to a bottle; Will mixed a
draught, and Nodder, sitting up, lifted the
pannikin with both hands, trembling violently.</p>

<p>I had listened with a mad heart; recollection
of what Tom had been made to suffer
by that foul, drunken, hideous scoundrel
rushed upon me. The villain had owned it
was drink and not caring; he had done it for
a promise of fifty pounds and the run of the
rum casks and a mate&#8217;s berth at some hundred
shillings a month! I could have torn the
poisonous rat&#8217;s eyes out as he lay, and turned
my back upon him to hide my face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>He threw the pannikin he had emptied
on to the deck: and said: &#8216;Gi&#8217; me hold of a
pen whilst I&#8217;m setting up; it&#8217;ll be a bruisy
queer scrawl. What music&#8217;s a-playing that
these hands keep dancing?&#8217; He looked at
his fingers with a horrid grin.</p>

<p>Bates put the bunk-board on the fellow&#8217;s
knees, and called to Will to hold the lamp
close. My temper was under control again,
and I looked at the man as he sat up in his
bunk, fearing that even now he might cheat
us by refusing to sign, though I supposed
that, in any case, the confession made to Mr.
Bates, and heard read aloud by us in Nodder&#8217;s
presence, would be counted good evidence.</p>

<p>The man&#8217;s hand trembled so violently that
twice or thrice he let fall the pen. &#8216;Hold my
wrist,&#8217; said he, with a vile oath. Helped by
Mr. Bates, he scrawled his name; we then
signed as witnesses, Bates leading, Collins
ending with a cross; the date was added, the
name of the brig, her situation at noon.</p>

<p>Nodder had fallen back, and lay watching
us while we signed. As Mr. Bates handed
me the written confession, the fellow in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
raw, squawking voice exclaimed: &#8216;Mix me
another pannikin, one of yer; then clear out.
You&#8217;ve got what you want, ha&#8217;n&#8217;t you?&#8217;</p>

<p>I passed through the hatch quickly, fearful
of the man&#8217;s language; Will accompanied me.
I glanced at him in the bright western daylight;
he looked shocked, almost stunned.</p>

<p>&#8216;I always knew he was innocent,&#8217; he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>But I was mad to join Tom. I held up
the paper as I ran towards the wheel, at
which stood Tom&#8217;s fine commanding figure,
solitary on the brig&#8217;s decks. He was pale,
and the shadow of bitter expectation lay like
a scowl or frown upon him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Has he confessed?&#8217; he said.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>

<p>Will took the wheel, and I followed my
sweetheart into the cabin. He put the paper
upon the table, and bent his head to read the
precious document. I watched his face with
impassioned intentness. I thought he had
read to the end of the writing when he lifted
his head; he rubbed his eyes and pressed his
temples betwixt his hands, bent his head to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
the paper again, and now I was very sure he
had not read a quarter down.</p>

<p>Mr. Bates came along the deck and entered
the cabin-door; I put my finger to my lips,
and he halted close behind Tom, who seemed
not to have heard him come. In this manner
three or four minutes passed, neither Bates
nor I speaking, and Tom appearing to read.
My sweetheart then fetched a deep breath,
and, looking round to me without seeing
Bates, he said: &#8216;That such a man should have
had it in his power to injure me so!&#8217; I saw a
mist in his eyes, and his breathing was
laboured; then perceiving Bates he grasped
him by both hands.</p>

<p>&#8216;Dear friend,&#8217; he cried, &#8216;it is a ruined,
broken-hearted convict sailor who thanks
you!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No more of that, Butler, for my sake,&#8217;
answered the mate. &#8216;You are no convict,
and your heart&#8217;s not broken. All&#8217;s well with
us now, and I&#8217;ll be dancing at your wedding
very soon.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I was innocent! I was always innocent!
I told you so!&#8217; cried Tom.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>&#8216;Did I ever doubt it, Butler?&#8217; exclaimed
the mate. &#8216;And this lady&#8217;s marvellous devotion!
Match me such perfect faith, such
beautiful loyalty.&#8217;</p>

<p>Tom stretched out his arms, and in a
moment I was locked to his heart.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XLV<br />


<small>SHE CONCLUDES HER STORY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Presently</span> the mate told us of the trouble
Nodder had cost him; how at one moment
the sulky villain bade him fetch paper and
pen, for that he meant to confess; how, as
Bates sprang to the hatch, the fellow rasped
out that he had changed his mind&mdash;bruised if
he was going to confess. Butler had never
offered him an extra glass of grog all the time
they were together; it was for Rotch to own
up, not him. First let him hear what Rotch
had to say. This went on till Bates, losing
his temper, told him he had as good as confessed
already; if he refused to dictate the
confession civilly asked of him, he (that is,
Bates) would quit the forecastle, clap the
hatch on, leave him to crawl about in the
dark, stop his supply of rum, and in every
way abandon him to a dreadful and miserable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
fate. &#8216;You&#8217;ve no friend on board but myself,&#8217;
Bates told him. &#8216;But for me you&#8217;d get
nothing to eat or drink. If Rotch confesses
first, he&#8217;ll put in a claim as Queen&#8217;s evidence,
the whole burden of this enormous crime will
be laid upon your shoulders, and whilst I&#8217;ll
take my oath that the punishment for it is
nothing less than the hulks and transportation
for life, I&#8217;ll not swear, as I&#8217;m no lawyer, that
it isn&#8217;t a hanging offence. Then I bade him
think of Rotch&#8217;s promise of fifty pounds, and
of the horrible mess that villain had got him
into, and by degrees so worked upon him as
to bring up his meanderings at last with a
round turn. &#8220;Jaw me no more!&#8221; growled the
beggar. &#8220;Go and fetch the smotherin&#8217; writing-gear!&#8221;
And there it is,&#8217; said the mate, with a
smile, pointing to the table.</p>

<p>In this while the sun was beyond north-west
and reddening rapidly, and now whilst
we listened to Mr. Bates the wind breezed up
in a shrill puff that heeled the vessel and despatched
Tom and the mate with a little run
on deck. I took Nodder&#8217;s confession and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
stowed it carefully away along with Collins&#8217;s
deposition. My heart was full of fire and
rejoicing; I raged at the thought of Tom
having been ruined by two such detestable,
contemptible villains as Rotch and Nodder,
and I exulted in knowing that it was now in
our power to bring both men to justice
whether Rotch confessed or not.</p>

<p>Whilst they looked after the brig I prepared
the evening repast in the galley. A
little before six we sat down to supper. It
was then blowing no more than a pleasant
fresh wind; a long swell hurled the brig forward,
and she drove along under a maintopgallant-sail,
whitening out twice her breadth
of water as she sped curtseying onwards.
Tom, Bates, and I seated ourselves, Collins
steered, and Will kept a look-out on the top of
the house.</p>

<p>I got ready a small tray of food for Rotch;
Bates was carrying it to the fellow&#8217;s berth
when Tom stopped him to say: &#8216;Tell him that
Nodder&#8217;s confessed, but add little or nothing
to that, Bates. Let the fact sink with him.
Whilst we sup we&#8217;ll talk things over.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>The mate returned after a very short absence,
and quietly took his place at table.</p>

<p>&#8216;Did you tell him?&#8217; said Tom. Bates
answered, &#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What did he say?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He eyed me with a wicked look and
made no reply. His eyes have gone bloodshot
and shine queerly. There&#8217;s a hardness
in that chap&#8217;s countenance that makes me
believe he&#8217;ll never shell out.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It will not matter,&#8217; said I, &#8216;we have evidence
enough. They&#8217;ll never refuse us a free
pardon on what we have.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;A free pardon!&#8217; exclaimed Tom, looking
at me.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes&mdash;certainly,&#8217; said Mr. Bates, gravely
cutting himself a piece of salt beef; &#8216;your
innocence is already established; nothing to
go through now but a sort of form which the
lawyers will put you up to.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Uncle Johnstone will do everything for
us,&#8217; said I; &#8216;and, oh!&#8217; I half shrieked, clapping
my hands, &#8216;the joy I shall feel in seeing
him read Nodder&#8217;s confession!&#8217;</p>

<p>Tom&#8217;s face was moody and dark.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>&#8216;I&#8217;ll not ask for nor would I accept a free
pardon!&#8217; he exclaimed. &#8216;For what am I to
be pardoned, and what to me would be the
particular virtue of a pardon?&#8217; he added
sarcastically. &#8216;When I sailed out of the
Thames in a convict ship, I left England for
ever. What could induce me to dwell in a
land I abominate, among a people I detest?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;A very natural prejudice, Butler,&#8217; said
Bates, &#8216;under the circumstances; but it will
wear off.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Marian,&#8217; said Tom, &#8216;whatever else I may
do, whatever else may happen to me, I shall
never again live in England.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Be it so, dear.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I could rant and talk like a stage-tragedy
man on that subject,&#8217; he continued. &#8216;We&#8217;ll
hold Nodder&#8217;s, and, if we can get it, we&#8217;ll hold
Rotch&#8217;s confession. We&#8217;ll take very great
care of them indeed. Oh, yes; they shall
be as precious&mdash;as precious&mdash;as what, Bates?
Well, let&#8217;s say Bank of England notes of the
highest value; because they might yet prove
serviceable by enabling me to deal with that
ruffian blunderer called British law, should its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
blind-guided hand make for my throat again
in the distant place where you and I may
settle, Marian. But I&#8217;ll have no asking for a
pardon.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;re a long way from home yet,&#8217; said
Bates. &#8216;The sight of the north star is bound
to work a change in your humour, Butler.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Bates, you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking
about!&#8217; exclaimed Tom. &#8216;Keep this in
mind, that under any circumstances I&#8217;d sooner
cut my throat than sue for pardon for sins
I&#8217;m guiltless of. But when you talk of Nodder&#8217;s
confession you forget this: First, if I
return to England, I&#8217;m a returned convict
at large during sentence, which is a felony
punishable by transportation for life. Next,
they&#8217;d charge me with piracy and bloodshed
as being concerned with others in seizing the
transport <i>Childe Harold</i>. Those are what
Johnstone&#8217;s father would call &#8220;counts,&#8221; I suppose.
Is Nodder&#8217;s confession going to carry
me clear of them?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I was mate of the transport. Butler,&#8217; said
Mr. Bates. &#8216;Then there&#8217;s young Johnstone,
who was an apprentice. Would not our evidence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
weigh? We could prove you innocent
of complicity in that seizure, and tell a story
that should do you honour&mdash;how you saved
my life; how you forced the convicts to yield
up the women and children.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I want no pardon! I&#8217;d take none!&#8217; cried
Tom, striking the table with his fist. &#8216;I&#8217;ll
never live in England again. I&#8217;ll take a new
name under any flag that flies, and the flag
whose people hate the English most is the
flag I&#8217;ll love best.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Then,&#8217; said Mr. Bates, looking at me,
&#8216;I don&#8217;t see what&#8217;s the good of Butler troubling
himself to extort a confession from
Rotch.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Rotch! yes!&#8217; cried Tom, shouting his
words in a sudden fury. &#8216;He&#8217;ll have to confess!
He must confirm Nodder&#8217;s statement
and whitewash me with another coat for your
edification, and to enable young Johnstone to
put a bit more of accent and colour into the
yarn he&#8217;ll spin his father and his mother. I&#8217;ll
keep him till he does, and, by God&#8217;s thunder,
I&#8217;ll hang him if he doesn&#8217;t!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Mr. Bates,&#8217; said I, &#8216;you have managed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
marvellously well with Nodder. Surely you&#8217;ll
bring the other wretch to confess.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Read Nodder&#8217;s statement to him,&#8217; said
Tom.</p>

<p>&#8216;He might snatch it from me and destroy
it,&#8217; said the mate. &#8216;There should be two of us.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Will&#8217;s too young!&#8217; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll go with you,&#8217; said Tom.</p>

<p>They settled it so, and fixed six o&#8217;clock
for the visit.</p>

<p>We were so slender a company in that
brig that I was often put to the wheel; I
never regularly stood a trick, as sailors say;
when they were all wanted I steered till one
of them relieved me. I went to the helm to
send Collins on the deck-house top that Will
might get his supper. As I quitted the cabin
Bates and Tom went to Rotch&#8217;s berth. There
was some noise in the wind at this hour; the
breeze blew fresh, the short seas ran sharp
and burst shrilly, the race of foam on either
hand sent up a note of boiling, there was
much merry whistling in the rigging, and a
faint small thunder of wind sweeping out of the
hollows through the curved foot of the sails.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>So it happened that I could hear but little
of what passed in the cabin. The wheel was
small; I gripped it strongly; I put my mind
into the binnacle-stand and watched the card
very earnestly, that the brig should not run
away with me.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes might thus have passed
when I heard noises that rose high above the
sound of the sea and the cries in the rigging.
Will shouted, &#8216;Marian, there&#8217;s murder
doing!&#8217;</p>

<p>I dared not let go of the wheel lest the
vessel should broach to and lose her spars. I
shrieked with all my might to Collins, who
came running headlong down the steps.</p>

<p>&#8216;Take the helm,&#8217; I cried, and I sprang
through the cabin-door.</p>

<p>At that instant Tom and Bates came out
of Rotch&#8217;s berth. The mate turned the key
and thrust his shoulder against the door to
make sure all was fast. Tom held a handkerchief
to his jaw. He removed it to look at it;
it was stained with blood.</p>

<p>&#8216;What has happened?&#8217; I called out.</p>

<p>&#8216;He jumped upon me, threw me down,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
and his teeth met in my cheek&mdash;a true hound
of hounds, a very dog of very dogs,&#8217; said Tom.</p>

<p>I drew his hand from his face and witnessed
the marks of a severe bite above the
right jaw; a little blood flowed.</p>

<p>&#8216;It is nothing at all,&#8217; said he. &#8216;But how
consistent is his trick of fighting with the
nature of the animal!&#8217;</p>

<p>I hastened to the galley for some warm
water, carefully bathed the wound, and bound
it up. Mr. Bates, whose face was very pale,
had gone on deck to look after the brig; he
now returned and found Tom at the table
with his face swathed.</p>

<p>&#8216;Has the villain gone mad?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Butler,&#8217; said the mate, &#8216;the sight of you
and your talking to him drove him mad. I
feared it. That man&#8217;ll never confess.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;ll hang then,&#8217; said Tom in a fierce,
muttering voice.</p>

<p>&#8216;In the face of Nodder&#8217;s confession,&#8217; cried
Mr. Bates, with more excitement in his
manner than I had ever before witnessed,
&#8216;the scoundrel swears that Butler was guilty
of the attempt. When we entered I addressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
him quietly, almost soothingly; Butler did
not speak, he stood in readiness to prevent
Rotch from snatching Nodder&#8217;s confession out
of my hands. I read the carpenter&#8217;s statement.
He listened with his head hung. When
I had ended, Butler said to him: &#8220;You see
now how it has worked out. When do you
intend to make your declaration to Mr. Bates?&#8221;
The man in an instant leaped upon Butler and
bore him to the deck. I got hold of his throat
to drag him away, and saw the devil&#8217;s teeth in
Butler&#8217;s cheek. I&#8217;m an old sea-going hand,
Miss Johnstone, and have been forced to listen
to some bad language in my time, but never
heard I the like of what left Rotch&#8217;s lips after
I had choked him off Butler and flung him
aside. His brain&#8217;s giving way,&#8217; said he, addressing
Tom.</p>

<p>&#8216;If he&#8217;s mad,&#8217; I exclaimed, heartily frightened,
&#8216;his bite may have poisoned you,
Tom.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;s dog-like enough,&#8217; said he, &#8216;but I
don&#8217;t fear his teeth. Bates, you forgot to tell
Miss Johnstone that before he sprang upon
me he called out, &#8220;You made the attempt,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
using one of the choicest of his diabolical
expressions.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We have Nodder&#8217;s confession,&#8217; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8216;But he shall confess&mdash;he shall confess,&#8217;
said Tom, with deep and thrilling intensity of
tone; &#8216;I have him&mdash;he can never escape me.
He shall confess, or he swings for it by my
hand as surely as God&#8217;s his judge.&#8217;</p>

<p>Saying this, he left the table and went on
deck.</p>

<p>&#8216;Mr. Bates,&#8217; said I, &#8216;how is the man to
be brought to own his crime?&#8217;</p>

<p>The mate looked at me earnestly and
slowly and shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;ll go out of his mind,&#8217; said he.
&#8216;That&#8217;s often how God punishes the like of
such wretches. He may confess as a madman,
but never while his wits yield light
enough to hold his hate in sight. Hate!
Why, with him the deadliest of human passions
lives wrapped up, pure and unalloyed,
in flesh, stalking on two legs, and calling
itself Rotch.&#8217;</p>

<p>He left me, and for many minutes I stood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
alone, leaning with my hand upon the cabin
table, lost in deep and distracting thought.</p>

<p>It so befell, however, that we were not
long to wait before this degrading, loathsome
and maddening business of Rotch was settled
for us, and this without any demand upon our
own ingenuity, though the thing worked out
to its issue in strict correspondence with the
inhuman devil&#8217;s nature and with all that is
base and wretched in this narrative. Whether
the man had been a little mad at the root all
through; whether he really feared that Tom
would execute his threat and hang him;
whether he supposed that, taking it that Tom
did not hang him, he would be fearfully
punished for the conspiracy and perjury
which Nodder had deposed to; or whether his
conscience, working like a fiend, grew too
strong for him during his long, solitary hours
of imprisonment, he, one day, fulfilled the
prediction of the mate and went mad.</p>

<p>We were then in the northern verge of
the south-east trade-wind, sweeping smoothly
toward the Equator. I was asleep in my
cabin, and was awakened by a great disturbance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
and shouts. The hour was some time
in the afternoon. By the time I had put on
my dress and run out, the cries and sounds of
scuffling had ceased; but on stepping a few
paces aft, I heard a strange noise of moaning
and snapping yells proceeding from Rotch&#8217;s
cabin. It was such a noise as might be
made by a couple of dogs, who, though half
dead with worrying each other, still fight
on.</p>

<p>I ran to the wheel, where I found Will,
who told me that while Bates was in Rotch&#8217;s
cabin, whither he had carried some drinking
water, Rotch, giving a loud shout, whipped a
table knife out of his bunk; he lunged at
Bates, who very nimbly tripped him up, got
the knife out of his hand, and lay wrestling on
the deck with Rotch, bawling for help. Tom
and Collins rushed to his assistance, and
amongst them dragged the villain into his
berth again.</p>

<p>Whilst Will was telling me this, Tom and
the others came out of Rotch&#8217;s cabin. And now
I heard that the man had gone mad, and that
to prevent him doing himself or us a mischief<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
they had secured his legs and bound his arms
to his side.</p>

<p>This was a very great calamity; had he
jumped overboard or cut his throat all would
have been well, but here now was a madman
to watch. Our little ship&#8217;s company was
miserably few, and the requirements of the
brig totally prohibited our telling off any one
of us to look after the lunatic fiend. Then
again, being mad, his confession (whatever
might prove the delirious gabble he chose to
regale Mr. Bates with) could be of no use to
Tom, who would thus be balked in his iron-hard
resolve of carrying him to some part of
the seas where he could hang him if he did
not confess.</p>

<p>But it was not a thing to be mended by
lamentation; whilst madness raged in the
unhappy, wicked wretch, he was to be kept
bound, and rendered as helpless by cords and
lines as Tom in his sanity had been by leg-irons
and handcuffs. Mr. Bates from time to
time looked in upon him, cut up his meat,
fed him, and gave him drink. I never went
near the monster&#8217;s cabin nor set eyes upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
him. If Tom looked in, Rotch spat at him,
howled, expressed by contortions and grimaces
a hundred hellish passions, and struggled
with fury and with the power of a giant to
liberate himself that he might get at him.
The madman&#8217;s cabin-door was in various ways
strengthened to provide against all possibility
of his breaking out. Otherwise he lay lodged
as securely as if his prison had been the
sentinelled and barricaded &#8217;tweendecks of the
<i>Childe Harold</i>.</p>

<p>This was his condition for about a week,
dating from the hour of his going mad;
Bates then told us that the fellow was cooling
down and exhibiting some return of mind;
a small light of intelligence was in his eyes,
and the fire of insanity was waning in
them. He begged for the freedom of his
limbs, and Bates gave him the use of his
arms. One morning the mate came out of
Rotch&#8217;s berth, and said to me, who was sitting
at the cabin table:</p>

<p>&#8216;A strange change has come over that
miserable creature. He cries like a whipped
boy, and his mind seems in a state of panic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
terror. He lay hold of my hand just now
and wriggled as though to fall upon his
knees, and implored me not to let Captain
Butler come near him. &#8220;He&#8217;ll hang me,&#8221; he
whimpered; &#8220;that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s keeping me
here for. Why don&#8217;t he send me ashore?
I&#8217;m not fit to die. I&#8217;ve got a wife and children
dependent upon me.&#8221; Then he blazed
out: &#8220;But he dursn&#8217;t hang me. It would be
the bloodiest of all murders to swing a poor
sick man like me!&#8221; And he muttered about
having a house of furniture and a little money
at home, all of which he&#8217;d give me if I&#8217;d
smuggle a knife into his berth, and then send
Captain Butler to him alone on pretence of
hearing him confess.&#8217;</p>

<p>It was on Friday that Bates told me this.
On the following Sunday we sat down to
dinner as usual at one o&#8217;clock. It was a very
quiet day, clear and bright; the brig was
flapping leisurely along clothed to her royals
before a small air of hot wind blowing almost
directly over the stern. Tom put a slice of
pork on a plate, and Bates cut it up to carry
it with biscuit, a pannikin of rum and water,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
and other matters to Rotch&#8217;s berth. The
mate went to the door of Rotch&#8217;s cabin, and
put the tray down to turn the key and shift
one of the uprights which protected the
entrance. My eye was upon him; he opened
the door, cried out, and sprang back, tossing
his arms with a gesture of horror and consternation.</p>

<p>&#8216;What is it?&#8217; called Tom.</p>

<p>&#8216;Come and look, Butler! Come and see
for yourself!&#8217; cried the mate.</p>

<p>Tom rushed aft and stood beside Bates.
In a moment or two he turned his face
toward me and said, whilst he pointed to the
cabin, with his finger a little elevated:
&#8216;Marian, he has hanged himself!&#8217; He then
went in. Bates, with a white face, came
running to the table for a knife, and then
joined Tom. I sat quite still. I had not the
courage to view an object which I guessed
would haunt my memory as a phantom of
ghastly horror whilst life lasted. My heart
beat with sick, fast throbs whilst I waited.
They were ten minutes in cutting him down
and making sure he was dead. They then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
came out, closing the door behind them, and
drew slowly to the table.</p>

<p>&#8216;Miss Johnstone,&#8217; said the mate, &#8216;he&#8217;s
stone dead.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Is it not God who wins, surely and
always, in the end?&#8217; exclaimed Tom.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">POSTSCRIPT</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the venerable lady&mdash;the Marian Johnstone
of the preceding narrative&mdash;had arrived
at this point, she declined to proceed. She
said she had told enough. If a sequel was
necessary, it must be invented. She had several
grandchildren, and she did not choose to vex
or distress them by unnecessary candour.</p>

<p>With much coaxing, however, and during
repeated visits, she let fall enough to admit of
a truthful ending to her strange tale, and the
few things material omitted by her were supplied
by Admiralty records and certain files of
shipping papers.</p>

<p>It seems that amongst them they safely
carried the little brig <i>Old Stormy</i> to the
English Channel, where, hauling in close to
the French coast, they spoke a French smack,
and Captain Butler went ashore to await
Marian Johnstone in some French or Flemish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
town that had been agreed upon. The brig
then stretched across to the English coast and
landed Nodder, who died twenty-four hours
after his arrival in England. Then, with the
assistance of a few &#8217;longshoremen, the vessel
was carried to the Thames.</p>

<p>Miss Johnstone at once called upon her
uncle. No particulars of an interview, which
surely must have been memorable and remarkable,
were to be procured. Though
Captain Butler had sworn that he would not
accept a free pardon if it were granted, nor
ever again set foot in his native country, Miss
Johnstone went to work nevertheless to
render him what is called by the lawyers an
unattainted person. It might have been that
Captain Butler knew the law better than she;
it is certain that her uncle, Mr. Johnstone, a
shrewd old lawyer, gave her neither hope nor
encouragement. His reasons are probably
indicated in an &#8216;opinion&#8217; he obtained from
one who stood high as a legal authority in his
day. The following extract may be given:</p>

<p>&#8216;The unfortunate master has apparently
been guilty of no less than three different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
felonies within the jurisdiction of the Lord
High Admiral, <i>i.e.</i> on the high seas. The
three felonies are (1) scuttling, of which he is
wrongfully convicted and transported; (2)
being at large during a sentence of transportation
without lawful excise&mdash;felony under
5 Geo. IV., c. 84, s. 24; and (3) of being
concerned with other convicts in piracy with
bloodshed, under 18 Geo. II., c. 30, s. 2. As
to pardons: All convictions are to be presumed,
of course, to be correctly made until
the contrary be shown. By 7 Geo. IV., c. 28,
a warrant under the royal sign manual is
equivalent to a pardon under the great seal,
and this only as a pardon as to the specific
felony committed by the pardoned, and does
not avail as to any offence committed subsequently
to that pardoned and not mentioned
in the pardon.&#8217;</p>

<p>The seizure of the <i>Childe Harold</i> had occurred
subsequently to Butler&#8217;s conviction for
attempting to scuttle the <i>Arab Chief</i>. He
was also at large whilst still a convict. Miss
Johnstone, with much spirit, but with a good
deal of wrong-headed obstinacy also, persisted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
in struggling in the direction of a pardon for
her sweetheart until certain convincing representations
finally determined her to desist.
Having made all necessary arrangements with
regard to her property, she joined Captain
Butler abroad and was married to him. They
ultimately went to the United States, and it
is understood that for some years Captain
Butler had command of a fine clipper ship
flying the Stars and Stripes and trading between
Boston and the western South American
seaboard.</p>

<p>The award for the salving of the <i>Old
Stormy</i> made a considerable sum. The cargo
proved to be exceedingly valuable. Some of
the pictures were by great masters, and the
consignment of china alone was valued at
eleven thousand pounds. Captain Butler,
through Miss Johnstone, refused to touch one
penny of the award; the money was therefore
paid in sums proportioned by the rating to Mr.
Bates, Will Johnstone, and the man Collins.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that the cabin story of
the abandonment of the <i>Old Stormy</i> proved
absolutely true. A single survivor of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
crew was rescued; he was carried to Sierra
Leone, where he died; before he died he
detailed the facts of the mutiny, murders, and
abandonment, precisely as they were recited
in the document found in the brig.</p>

<p>The <i>Childe Harold</i> was fallen in with by
a large heavily armed Portuguese man-of-war,
thirty leagues west of the island of Tristan
d&#8217;Acunha. She had been wrecked aloft in a
gale; the convicts were in terrible distress,
they were short of water, they had wantonly
wasted the ship&#8217;s stock of provisions. The
commander of the Portuguese ship perceiving
the vessel&#8217;s character sent a number of armed
men on board, and then, strangely enough,
towed her for a supply of fresh water to
Tristan d&#8217;Acunha, where both ships arrived
three weeks after the departure of the <i>Old
Stormy</i> from that island. The transport was
then conveyed to Table Bay, refitted, placed
in charge of a new captain and officers along
with a strong crew, and despatched on her
voyage to Hobart Town, where she safely
arrived. How the ringleaders were punished
has not been ascertained.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>The long-boat, containing Captain Sutherland,
Captain Barrett, the soldiers, women
and children, was fallen in within seven or
eight degrees north latitude, and the people,
who were all in good health in spite of great
sufferings from exposure&mdash;one death only, a
child, having happened&mdash;were carried round
the Horn before there occurred an opportunity
to tranship and send them home. But the
quarter-boats in which the seamen had been
sent adrift were never accounted for.</p>

<p>This, then, is the true sequel of the extraordinary
adventures of the remarkable young
woman who has been styled in this narrative
of her experiences Marian Johnstone.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
